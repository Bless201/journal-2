//     <h3>Abstract</h3>
//     <p className="abstract">
//       This article discusses the similarities and differences in Quine and Heidegger on Being. It means that the view of Heidegger on Being is quite different from Quine. While Quine, an American contemporary philosopher, believes that ontology is determined by language, Martin Heidegger, a German contemporary philosopher, believes that Being has been forgotten by all other philosophers and his contribution to philosophy is to recover the real meaning of Being. For him, Being is a mystery, but Being reveals itself through poetic language. What is common between Quine and Heidegger is that they are interested in language. The difference between them is that Quine accepts reality within the context of language which is social and not private, while Heidegger believes that it is only in silent meditation that human beings can approach Being. Our method is textual analysis.

//     <h3>Introduction</h3>
//     <p>
//       In this world, there are so many ways of looking at things. In our culture, we say one does not stay at a particular place to watch the masquerade; one moves from one point to the other. Quine says that there is no universal reality, that reality is determined by language. Heidegger believes that Being is the ground of all beings and also Being is a mystery. Quine sees reality differently from Heidegger, but they also have something in common, and that is language. In this work, we are reflecting on what is Being, Quine’s being, Heidegger’s Being, similarities and differences between Quine and Heidegger, evaluation, and conclusion. Instead of wasting much time, let us begin with what is Being.
//     </p>

//     <h3>What is Being?</h3>
//     <p>
//       The problem of “being” disturbed the mind of philosophers right from pre-Socratics to the contemporary period. Even though being cannot be defined, it has an origin. The term “being” etymologically means in Latin <em>Ens</em>, Greek <em>On</em>, French <em>Estant</em>, German <em>Sein</em>, which connotes existing.
//     </p>
//     <p>
//       For Aristotle, whatever “is” is a being. Being can be a goat, a house, a man, a stone, or an angel. St. Thomas Aquinas follows Aristotle’s metaphysics in identifying “being” as “being” but maintains that “God is ‘being’ par excellence while creatures are being in an analogical sense.”
//     </p>

//     <h3>Quine on Being</h3>
//     <p>
//       Ontology plays a very large role in Quine’s philosophy and was one of the major preoccupations from his early 30s to the end of his life. For him, ontology provided a basic framework for most discussions in analytical philosophy in the second half of the twentieth century. According to Quine, there are three main themes in ontology: ontological commitment, ontological reduction, and criteria of identity.
//     </p>
//     <p>
//       Quine’s famous slogan, “To be is to be the value of a variable,” emphasizes that ontology is determined by the commitments of a theory expressed in logical notation. For Quine, there is no universal being; being is relative to language.
//     </p>

//     <h3>Heidegger on Being</h3>
//     <p>
//       Heidegger shows us that there is a meaningful conception of Being, a conception that underlines all our understanding of reality. For Heidegger, “Being” (<em>Sein</em>) is different from beings (<em>Seindes</em>). Being is not a substance but an event, and it reveals itself as a mystery. Heidegger believes that Being conceals and unconceals itself and that it is only through poetic language and silent meditation that human beings can approach Being.
//     </p>

//     <h3>Similarities and Differences</h3>
//     <p>
//       Both Quine and Heidegger emphasize the importance of language in understanding ontology. However, Quine views ontology as relative to language and denies the existence of universals, while Heidegger sees Being as the ground of all beings and a mystery that transcends language.
//     </p>

//     <h3>Conclusion</h3>
//     <p>
//       Heidegger believes that Being is a mystery and leaves it in continuous mystery. Quine, on the other hand, grounds ontology in language and rejects universals. Both philosophers offer unique insights into the nature of Being, but their approaches differ significantly.
