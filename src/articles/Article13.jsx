    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p className="abstract">
      The study involves 60 primary school teachers from three districts in the coastal region of East 
      Java, Banyuwangi, Trenggalek and Pacitan to provide an assessment of the model curriculum 
      developed and 3 schools were used as a test implementation of the curriculum SDN 9 Tegalharjo 
      Banyuwangi, SDN 3 Watugunung Trenggalek, rind SDN 3 Pacitan in Pacitan. From the 
      results of the assessment carried out by the teacher, it can be seen that the model is very 
      appropriate to the needs of teachers to teach science material in accordance with the disaster 
      problems that occur in the coastal areas of East Java. The result of a teacher questionnaire 
      showed that the response of teachers to the curriculum were very positive. The student learning 
      outcomes of disaster knowledge showed a significant increase between the pre test and post test. 
      Students have a good knowledge about mitigation technique and disaster responsiveness, they 
      can describes potential disasters also mention what kind of activities that lead to disaster in the 
      coastal area.

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Indonesia very closed with disaster. There have been many disasters in Indonesia. The 
      National Emergency Agency (NEA) or Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana 
      (BNPB) reported there were 238 disaster events on 2014, consisting of flooding, 
      landslide, typhoon, flooding with landslide, forest fire, and earthquake in measuring 
      greater than five on the Richter scale. This condition caused a total of 174 of deaths, at 
      least and 5127 homes were damaged. Majority caused by flooding especially in Jakarta 
      and surrounding urban area (OCHA: 2014). This condition is so vulnerable enough to 
      give an overview of the potential catastrophic condition of the people in this country. 
      Local and national governments, international institutions and non-government 
      organizations pay attention to educate people to be more aware of disaster and become 
      prepare when disaster occurs (Adiyoso, W & Kanegae H, 2012). There government 
      bodies began to give serious attention to the problem of disaster and established 
      disaster management centers in areas that are expected to provide services to the public 
      related to disaster problems that often occur. This step is considered very effective in 
      order to equip the people especially those living in disaster areas. Communication 
      Ministry of Indonesia or Depkominfo (2009) reported there are some problems about 
      consciousness attitude disasters in coastal areas, such as the lack of knowledge about 
      disaster, the level of economic, social and culture.
    </p> 
    <br />

    <p>Actually, the coastal people know that disasters is damage but unbeaten with an 
      attitude of maintaining the family's economic circumstances. According them, the 
      disaster was a blessing for some people because it will get support from other parties. 
      Panic,M et.al (2013) reported that disaster education not only give information but 
      should guide students to understanding about disaster problems, disaster awareness, 
      and disaster response. In order to raise consciousness toward disaster response 
      education should start early. It required an appropriate educational process, so it 
      requires a mechanism that integrates educational disaster responsiveness in learning 
      activities with the expectation that students have a good preparedness about a potential 
      disaster in the region. "Preparedness has become a common term used in terms of 
      home land security and disaster planning documentation" (Preston, J., 2012:2). East 
      Java has the potential for disaster is huge and diverse, such as typhoon, floods, 
      landslides, earthquakes, tsunamis, and many other disasters. That everything should be 
      well recognized by students related to how to minimize risk in events of a disaster and 
      make decisions when getting an early sign of disaster. In this case, to be required a 
      disaster curriculum that appropriate with coast condition. This study focused to 
      measure teacher's understanding about disaster curriculum, students knowledge and 
      skill disaster preparedness.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Disaster Education in Learning Science</h3>
    <p>Panic' et al (2013) reported the disaster awareness in education is important to 
      minimize of risk. Education should increase student's competency and knowledge that 
      will apply if disaster occurs (Mutarak, R & W. Pothisiri, 2013). Processes and 
      mechanisms required systematic and carried out responsibly. To achieve this goal, 
      schools as an educational institution must cultivate an attitude of disaster awareness to 
      learners seriously. Ronan K.R, & Johnston, D., in Adiyoso, W & Kanegae H, (2012) 
      reported that the disaster education programs has priority to change students 
      preparedness attitude and then children's knowledge, critical awareness and risk 
      perception. In addition, Unesco (2007) give a guide line for disaster education system. 
      A purpose from this program is students can improve their chance of surviving 
      disaster if they understand about disaster and students have good decision if the 
      disasters occur. Disaster education is important for students who live in coastal area. 
      Integration with science is feasible. Science curriculum for elementary school in 
      Indonesia has some contents to prepare students for understanding about environment 
      and disaster. The science curriculum has emphasizes to hands-on experience through 
      practical activities. It can develop competence among students with multiple objectives, 
      knowledge and science concepts that are useful in everyday life as well as to develop 
      the skills, to investigate the nature around, and solve his problems (Depdikbud, 2008).
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>Smith, M.U & Harvey, S (2004) reported that the primarily purposes of science 
      education learning is students should be have knowledge and understanding in 
      science. Students have good participation and teachers have a good appreciation 
      (Sandra K.A, Ken A, Deborah L.H, 2010). The science curriculum has purpose to 
      provide direct experience to express some ideas and demonstrating science skill to 
      students. Martin R in Howe (1993) gives definition about science, "Science is not just 
      collection of laws, a catalogue of unrelated facts. It is creations of the human mind with 
      its freely invented ideas and concepts". Nancy, P and Margery, M to describes about 
      science, it is an observations about what happen, try to observe with commonsense, 
      using new knowledge for make prediction about something will be done, and proofing 
      truly from a prediction (Carin: 1993). Boleman (1955) expressing, that modern scientist 
      not only received a hypothesis or theory just like that, but confirmation is needed. This 
      is important to evidence of theories. Students must engage in science process so that 
      they have not different perceptions about concept that can lead to misconceptions. 
      Science is specific knowledge that assess about nature through scientific stage and 
      scientific attitudes.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>The Development of Disaster Curriculum Model</h3>
    <p>To be able to properly carry out of education disaster, required a school curriculum and 
      implemented seriously. Especially for schools in coastal area of East Java average is 
      proneness. There was a significant effect of curriculum based disaster education 
      program on the combined dependent variables such as school children's knowledge, 
      risk perceptions, critical awareness, individual preparedness and school preparedness 
      (Adiyoso, W & Kanegae H, (2012). The curriculum was developed to be able to access 
      the local issues that will have a positive impact on the growth and development of 
      learners. Marsh, JC, (2004) said, "Curriculum is all learning planned for which the 
      school is responsible". The concept of the curriculum according to the government 
      statement as stipulated in government regulation. The curriculum is a set of plans and 
      arrangements regarding the purpose, content, and teaching materials and methods 
      used to guide the organization of learning activities to achieve specific educational 
      goals. One of the materials can be integrated with the science curriculum related to 
      disaster problems that arise in the coastal region of East Java. The sciences of 
      curriculums education in accordance with the problems that arise in coastal areas need 
      careful planning.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>Activities to identify problems that will be a major review of the curriculum is 
      necessary. Tyler, R express about elements underlying the development of curriculum 
      that is presented in the form of questions, consists of:
    </p>
    <br />

    <div style={{marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
      <ol>
        <li>What educational purposes should the school seek attain?</li>
        <li>How can educational experiences be provided that are likely to achieve that purposes?</li>
        <li>How can these experiences be effectively organized?</li>
        <li>How can we determine whether these purposes are being attained? (Kemp., JE, 1997)</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <p>
      The questions above lead to what goals will be formulated in the curriculum, how the 
      learning process is implemented to achieve these objectives, and how to measure the 
      achievement of these goals. Each curriculum should be based on the principle of the 
      best (excellence) so that each student can achieve the best for themselves and their 
      environment. Student must hold the appropriate standards with good ability on the 
      moral aspects, ethics, knowledge, or other aspects. Given that every student has the 
      aptitude, interest and motivation are different, then the difference should also be 
      considered so that the status of the specified quality standards for all (Depdikbud: 
      2008). The elementary science curriculum development that was first to be done is the 
      analysis of the need of the schools. For schools in coastal areas have different needs 
      compared to other schools.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>How to prepare students to be aware of the disaster is an important priority in teaching 
      material science. Identify problems and potential environmental and potential disasters 
      that appear in the coastal environment is used as a basis to formulating science learning 
      objectives should be oriented on mitigation techniques and disaster responsiveness by 
      considering the school conditions. Design curriculum is prepare in accordance with the 
      provisions of the National Education Standards include objectives, content, methods, 
      organization, and assessment. The purpose of the curriculum is formulated in 
      accordance with the rules of national education goals and in accordance with the needs 
      of problem-oriented school disaster in the coastal region of East Java. Curriculum 
      content includes knowledge about the disaster, the skills to know about the signs of 
      nature, skill in applying mitigation techniques and integrated disaster responsiveness 
      in science curriculum. Figure 1, show the process of curriculum implemented and 
      disseminated.

    <p>Associated methods with the stages of implementation of the curriculum that can be 
      implemented in schools in the achievement of educational goals as outlined in the 
      curriculum. Organizing curriculum describes how the role of teachers and principals in 
      implementing a curriculum that has been developed and implemented an evaluation to 
      determine how the curriculum can be achieved effectiveness.

    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>
      The focus of this research is the implementation of a model science curriculum 
      education that integrates mitigations technique and responsiveness of disaster 
      mitigation at primary school students in the coastal area of East Java. The research 
      involve of 60 primary teachers in the coastal region of East Java. There are three 
      districts were chosen as a test site, Banyuwangi, Trenggalek and Pacitan. These districts 
      are considered to have great potential disasters and disaster conscious attitude of the 
      public school quite low. Each district is represented 20 teachers are expected to be 
      delivered to teachers and other school teachers through discussion forums. In this 
      research, that have fourth important point will measure, such as:

        <li>Some constraints in science curriculum model applications.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
      Some instrument used in this research, such as: questioner sheet, observations sheet, 
      pre test and post test instrument for pilot schools students. This research used 
      qualitative and quantitative approach. Qualitative approach used for suitability of 
      science curriculum models with disaster and the constraints of science curriculum 
      models applications. Quantitative approach use for describes students understanding 
      about disaster in learning science.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>
      Teacher worthiness assessment should measure from some component, such as: 
      suitability indicators and learning purpose, suitability learning activity and basic 
      competency, the integration between cognitive, affective, and psychomotor in the 
      curriculum model, content analysis and organizing materials, suitability assessing 
      technique in curriculum model, learning models in curriculum and applying 
      curriculum model in coastal area. Figure 2, showed about assessing worthiness from 
      almost to disaster curriculum.

      Disaster responsiveness taught relatively more difficult than the knowledge of the 
      disaster. In the attitude of learning required a process of habituation. However, in this 
      study assessed attitudes based on students' answers related to what to do after finding 
      early signs of disaster. Here is presented the students' answers related to the type of 
      disaster, an early sign of disaster and disaster responsiveness:

    <h3>Findings and Discussion</h3>
    <p>
      The model curriculum is implemented to get a positive response from teachers  
      in the coastal region of East Java. This provides opportunities associated with the 
      expected development of science curriculum according to the needs of learning science 
      in the coastal region of East Java, which is considered very vulnerable to disasters. In 
      general, the assessment of teachers in Banyuwangi, Trenggalek and Pacitan stated that 
      the curriculum model developed considered feasible and appropriate to be applied in 
      the region. Associated with content selection and organization of material with material 
      disaster, 5% stated quite appropriate, 40% stated accordingly, and 55% said very 
      appropriate. About the suitability of the learning models used in teaching materials 
      science techniques that integrate mitigation and disaster responsiveness, 25% stated 
      they were quite very appropriate. Associated with adherence to the elementary science 
      curriculum for the coastal region of East Java, 5% less than the corresponding states, 
      15% is quite appropriate, corresponding to 60% and 20% are very appropriate. This 
      means that teachers can implement optimistic for the curriculum model well. While 
      related to the conformity of a model curriculum with disaster issues in the district of 
      Banyuwangi, Trenggalek and Pacitan, 5% less than the corresponding states, 10% is 
      quite appropriate, the corresponding 60% and 25% said they had very appropriate.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      There are some records that conveyed by the teacher related to the improvement of a 
      model curriculum that integrates science and responsiveness of disaster mitigation for 
      elementary students in the coastal area of East Java. Student learning outcomes mean 
      well, generally based on the above data the students already have a good knowledge of 
      the material mitigation and disaster responsiveness, all students (100%) should 
      mention of the potential for disaster in their area and also students are able to mention 
      the activities of the public good catastrophic in the area around the student. The 
      problem is still not well understood is about the introduction of the early signs of 
      disaster, the surface appearance changes caused by the disaster, evacuation routes and 
      benefits as well as rescue actions during an earthquake. The curriculum must be 
      dynamic to follow the development of the key problems in the neighborhood. In the 
      school curriculum, more emphasis is placed on shaping the learning experience for 
      students in order to achieve educational goals. As presented by Dr. Cheng Hon-Kwan 
      in his message as chair of the curriculum developer in Hong Kong- China,
    </p>

    <div className="quote-box" style={{backgroundColor: '#f5f5f5', padding: '15px', margin: '15px 0', fontStyle: 'italic'}}>
      <p>"…..it is not enough to impart them with mere 'knowledge. Instead, we have to help them develop a global outlooks, equip them with a repertoire of skills and the positive attitudes to respect knowledge and to learn how to learn" <br />(Hongkong Special Administrative Region of RRC. 2000).
      </p>
    </div>
    <br />

    <p>
      In the curriculum just is not enough emphasis on knowledge, but should be able to 
      help students so knowledgeable and equip students with the skills and positive 
      attitude that respect for knowledge and learning how to learn; often departing from the 
      learning process instead of the teacher and the student. There is an impression that the 
      implemented learning because teachers who want not because of an attempt to answer 
      the curiosity of students resulting in a "coercive" less meaningful. Lessons will not be 
      worth anything if it only relies on knowledge alone. Gutek, GL states within one point 
      of the definition of education:
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      The act or process of providing a person with the knowledge, skill, competence, or 
      usually desirable qualities of behavior or character by a formal course of study, 
      instruction, or training (Gutek, GL: 2004).
    </p>
    <br />

      to students in the coastal areas of East Java conclusions can be formulated as follows:
    </p>
    <br />
    <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-4" style={{marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
      <li>Teacher assessment in 3 districts associated with a model curriculum that 
        integrates science and responsiveness of disaster mitigation is considered 
        feasible applied coastal region of East Java and in accordance with the needs of 
        schools in the coastal areas of East Java.</li>
      <li>Skills of teachers in implementing a model curriculum that integrates  
        engineering science and responsiveness of disaster mitigation rated average to 
        good.</li>
      <li>Response of teachers to the curriculum model developed very well, it is shown 
        from the results of the questionnaires filled by teachers on average judge agreed 
        and strongly agreed.</li>
      <li>Results of the average student learning both general based on the above data the 
        students already have a good knowledge of engineering materials mitigation 
        and disaster responsiveness, all students (100%) to mention the potential for 
        disaster in their area and students can also mention the well community 
        activities that lead to disaster in the area around the student are not well 
        understood about the introduction of the early signs of disaster, the surface 
        appearance changes caused by the disaster, evacuation routes and benefits as 
        well as rescue actions during an earthquake.</li>
