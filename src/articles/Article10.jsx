    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p className="abstract">
      This cross-sectional study was carried out to report on height, sitting height and skelic index of 171 Pietersburg street boys aged 6 to 10 years and to estimate the percentage prevalence of stunting amongst them. Anthropometric measurements were carried out on each subject according to the International Working Group of Kinanthropometry (IWGK). Sitting height measurements were greater than leg length measurements among Pietersburg street boys. Their mean height showed a similar pattern of growth as that of American NHANES III reference sample from the age 6 to 7, but shows greater differences from age 8 to 10 years. The skelic values are below 100% of sitting height and the mean HAZ Z-scores approximate -0.4 at age 6 years and deteriorates to -2.4 at age 10 years. This deterioration increases the percentage prevalence of stunting. The growth patterns of Pietersburg street boys give a clear indication of the effects of poor nutrition, low level of hygiene and overall quality of life of the children.

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Pattern of human growth is important in monitoring the health status of children (Steendijk et al., 1984; Wiley, 1995). Malnutrition and disease are the most important features that affect the growth patterns of children particularly in the rural areas. The patterns of human growth have been well documented in arctic and subarctic populations of Europe and North America but in South African publications, the majority of studies were carried out on pre-school and school children aged 2 to 18 years. No research findings could be found on street boys in South Africa (Evelenth & Tanner, 1976; Richardson, 1977; 1978; Meredith, 1979; Steyn et al., 1992; Cameron et al., 1992; Monyeki, 1995; Wiley, 1995). Richardson (1978) and Meredith (1979) emphasised that urban black African boys have longer leg length compared to sitting height and are taller than rural boys of South Africa and Africa in general. In all the studies there is no information pertaining to the growth patterns of street boys especially on height and skelic index. The percentage prevalence of stunting for rural boys was greater (about 35%) compared to urban boys (about 16%) of South Africa (Richardson, 1977; 1978; Cameron et al., 1991; Steyn et al., 1992). The percentage prevalence of stunting for South African street boys has not been documented in the literature. Street boys eat and sleep in unfavourable and unhygienic conditions, which pose a serious threat to their health and general well being. They are always in poor conditions when one comes across them in the streets.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      This study was carried out to achieve the following aims: 1). To report on the height and skelic index of Pietersburg street boys aged 6-10 years; 2). To estimate the percentage prevalence of stunting among the boys. The findings were compared to the American NHANES III reference sample and data on pre-school and primary school children in different parts of South Africa and other African countries. It is hoped that the findings will provide clearer understanding on the growth patterns of street boys and those children having better socioeconomic conditions.

    <h3>Material And Method</h3>
    <h4>Subjects</h4>
    <p>
      The study was initiated in December 1996 and concluded in January 1997. The sample consisted of 171 street boys aged 6 to 10 years in Pietersburg, Northern Province of South Africa. Subjects' selection was done at various places in Pietersburg. Measurements were taken at the selected places in the business area, which is the major source of attraction to the street boys who beg for food. Seven students from the Department of Kinesiology and Physical Education who were trained by Prof. Carter, Prof. Amusa, Dr. Toriola, Dr. de Ridder and Dr. Wekesa at the Potchefstroom University for CHE, in preparation for the 1995 Harare All-Africa Games Kinanthropometric Project assisted in data collection. Anthropometrists were required to undertake reliability testing as part of their training and to achieve technical errors within internationally accepted limits (Cameron, 1984; De Ridder, 1993; Carter et al., 1994). Subjects were given incentives like bread, cold drinks, sweets and biscuits after the anthropometric measurements were completed on them.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Sample sizes below the age of 5 years and above 10 years were less than 20. Consequently, they were not considered statistically viable and were excluded from the analysis. Oral interviews were done on the following: the subjects' ethnicity, socioeconomic status, birth date, last school attended and why they decided to live in the streets. Three somatic variables were determined by direct measurements, every subject being measured by one anthropometrist and re-measured by another. When the two records for particular dimensions were in close agreement, the average value was used as the criterion score. For the purpose of measurement precision, differences between measurements greater than 0.3 cm for standing height, sitting height and leg length were rejected. When the initial determinations did not satisfy the applicable criterion, two additional independent determinations were made with the value taken to represent the dimension of metric scale, the average of the homogeneous three.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Stature</h4>
    <p>
      The instrument used was the Martin anthropometer with a broca plane. The measurer had the subject stand erect barefoot with the heels together and the arms hanging naturally by the sides. The heels, buttocks, upper part of the back and the back of the head are in contact with Martin anthropometer. An assistant positions the subject's head, instructs him to take a deep breath. One of the measurer ensures that the subject's heels are not elevated while the other measurer applies stretch force by cupping the subject's head and applying gentle traction alongside the mastoid process. The first measurer brings the broca plane firmly down into contact with the vertex (Ross & Marfell-Jones, 1991; Carter et al., 1994).
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Sitting height</h4>
    <p>
      This variable was measured on a box with the feet on the floor. Care was taken to ensure that the subject does not push with the leg. An assistant orientates the subject's head in the Martin anthropometer and instructs him to take a deep breath and sits as tall as possible, while he applies gentle traction to the mandible. The anthropometrist positions the anthropometer to the sitting base and brings the branch down the hair, making firm contact with the vertex (Ross & Marfell-Jones, 1991; Carter et al., 1994).
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Leg length</h4>
    <p>
      Projected height from the box to the trochanterion. The subject stood with feet together and the lateral aspect of the right leg kept in touch with the box. The end pointer was placed flushed against the box and the housing pointer was extended vertically upwards to the marked trochanterion site. Then leg length was the total measurement of the box together with the readings found on the segmometer (Carter et al., 1994; de Ridder, 1995).
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Skelic index</h4>
    <p>
      Skelic index was computed using the formula: Lower limb x 100/sitting height (Meredith, 1979). With standing height partitioned into two parts, this index registers the quantitative relativity of subschia - sole distance to height of the body stem.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Analysis</h4>
    <p>
      The analysis addresses the problem of under-nutrition, which was experienced by the subjects when entering the street life. Data were analysed by using descriptive statistics to determine patterns for height, sitting height, leg length and skelic index. Independent t-tests were applied to determine the significant differences between this sample and the American NHANES III reference sample (Frisancho, 1990). Furthermore, height-for-age z-scores values were calculated to determine the percentage prevalence of stunting within the Pietersburg street boys' sample.
    </p>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>
      Presented in Table 1 are descriptive statistics for stature, sitting height, leg length and height-for-age (HAZ) z-scores. Sitting height measurements were greater than leg length measurements with variables exhibiting less mean values at the age of 8 years among Pietersburg street boys. Mean leg length is lower at the age of 10 years while there is a gradual increase in sitting height measurements from the age of 9 to 10 years.

      Mean heights of the street boys exhibit a similar pattern as that of the American NHANES III reference sample with the latter sample being slightly taller than the street boys aged of 6 to 7 years (Figs. 1 and 2). However, the street boys' mean height and standard deviation deviate from the American NHANES III reference sample aged 8 to 10 years. The street boys were shorter as compared to American NHANES III reference sample in all variables with great differences of 9.32 cm for stature and 6.5 cm for sitting height (Table 1 and Figs. 1 and 2). The American NHANES III reference sample were significantly taller than the street boys aged 8 to 10 years (p&lt;0.001) in stature and aged 6 to 10 years in sitting height (p&lt;0.05) (Frisancho, 1990).

    <br />

    <p>
      The skelic index values were below 100% of sitting height. The Pietersburg street boys had generally short leg length relative to their trunk with a mean limb length ranging from 91 % to 98.7% below the sitting height. The mean lower limb length of 98 % below the sitting height clearly exhibits better growth patterns of the street boys at an early age compared to older age (91 % at age 8 years). The mean HAZ z-scores approximate -0.4 at age 6 and deteriorates to -2.4 at the age 10. This deterioration increases the percentage prevalence of stunting from 37.5 at age 6 years to 72.7% at age 10. (cf. Table 1). The fact that the street boys reflect deficit in the growth patterns of height from age 6 to 10 years clearly depicts that they experience chronic under nutrition (Table 1). This evidence is clearly supported by the low z-scores of HAZ among these boys.

    <h3>Discussion</h3>
    <p>
      The above observations suggest that poor environmental conditions, parental care and poor diet play a significant role in the patterns of human growth. Several studies on the height of rural South African children have shown similar patterns of growth (Cameron et al., 1988; Monyeki, 1995). Differences in growth patterns of the street boys and the American NHANES III reference sample were not biologically significant at an early age but were pronounced among older children (8 to 10 years). This may be attributed to the effect of the environmental impact on these boys as they live in the streets.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      The fact that the leg length of Pietersburg street boys decreases from age 7 to 8 years probably suggests a delay in adolescent growth spurt in height (Malina & Bouchard, 1991). Similar findings were reported among rural children of South Africa but the result of this study shows greater deficit in height values (Richardson, 1978; Cameron et al., 1988; 1991; Monyeki, 1993). A striking feature about this sample is the high level of stunting from age 8 to 10 years (Table 1) and the continued poor growth patterns with increasing age. The overall mean of -1.7 z-scores units for the street boys sample with a mean percentage prevalence of stunting of 62% is high compared to the percentage prevalence of stunting noted for Pedi children (30%) in the rural areas of the Northern Province (Steyn et al., 1992), and to children in rural Kenya (37%), Lesotho (23%) and Swaziland (30%) (Government of Lesotho/US AID, 1976; Nutritional Council, 1985; Haag et al., 1986). Thus it appears that the high level of stunting among the street boys, as found in children in most developing countries, reflects adverse socioeconomic status (Martorell et al., 1988).
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      The growth patterns of the Pietersburg street boys are a reflection of their traditional diet and poor environmental factors. They also probably explain the boys' morphological growth retardation patterns compared with rural children in other parts of South Africa (Richardson, 1977; 1978; Cameron, 1991; Cameron et al., 1992; Steyn, 1992). Most of these boys (97.2%) reported that they left their homes because of lack of food and corporal punishment imposed on them by their parents, teachers and other family members. Their survival is only dependent on begging, stealing and eating contaminated food from rubbish bins.
    </p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      It is apparent that the poor growth patterns found amongst the Pietersburg street boys are a reflection of their poor parental care, nutritional intake and the environmental impact associated with the developing nature of the Northern province of South Africa.
    </p>

    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
    <p>
      The South African Ministries of Social Welfare and Health should embark on a large-scale nutritional surveillance of the street boys so that data would be available with which appropriate government policies could be formulated to cater for their education, health and welfare. This can be accomplished with the help of appropriate community structures and will help lower the currently high crime rate in South Africa.
