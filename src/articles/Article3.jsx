    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p className="abstract">
      The majority of Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) cannot afford to adequately finance their production activities. In Tanzania, a number of local and externally funded agencies have been involved in financing MSEs activities through projects. However, most of these credit schemes have been characterized by inefficient financial intermediation such that they often impose high transaction costs on either lenders or borrowers or both. This study attempts to investigate transaction costs in Micro and Small Enterprise (MSEs) credit schemes in Mwanza and Arusha districts. Specifically the study aims at; (i) estimating the lender-borrower loan transaction costs in MSEs lending programmes, (ii) assessing how transaction costs vary across different types of lenders and in different areas, (iii) identifying factors that affect the transaction costs incurred by borrowers, and (iv) determining the consequences of the transaction costs on credit demand. Primary data will be obtained using a structured questionnaire administered to 120 Micro and Small Enterprise borrowers randomly selected from the two districts together. A checklist will also be used to interview the lending projects in the study areas. Much of the analysis will be based on descriptive statistics to summarize survey results. However, multiple regression analyses will be carried out to identify the determinants of borrowing transaction costs, together with the consequent effects of the costs on loan demand. This study will recommend measures to be taken at both the organizational and national policy level towards the development of a viable and sustainable financial market for MSEs.

    <h3>Background Information</h3>
    <p>
      Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) have been an important source of incomes not only to people who could not find employment in the other sectors but also provide an important cushion to falling incomes of employees in the formal sector. In addition they are an important source of off-farm and non-farm employment in the countryside. When looking on the country's ongoing poverty reduction initiatives as presented in key policy documents, they acknowledge the informal (where most of the MSEs fall) sector's role in poverty alleviation. Vision 2025 addresses broad based growth, which can be achieved through developing private sector enterprises including MSEs. The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PESP) has concentrated its efforts on, reducing income poverty, improving human capabilities, survival and social well being and containing extreme vulnerability among the poor. It has outlined a number of policies and strategies whose target is to enhance economic growth and equity. Policies for economic growth include a set of macroeconomic policies under which the government is expected to create an enabling environment for the informal sector to operate and create more employment opportunities.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The 1991 (national) informal sector survey estimated 2.4 million people informally employed (excluding small-scale rural agriculture). Out of these, 60% were employed in rural areas; and 40% in urban areas. 50% of the informal sector firms were engaged in trade-related activities, 22% in manufacturing and 10% in urban agriculture and fishing. Using the 1995 informal sector survey of Dar es Salaam we can estimate a trend growth in this sector. In 1991, 316,000 people were informally employed in Dar es Salaam, in 1995 there were 346,000 people employed - implying a growth rate of 2.4% per year. This contrasts with static or falling formal wage employment after adjustment. Thus, promotion and development of the informal sector consisting mostly of Micro and Small Enterprises (MSEs) is seen as accelerating the achievements of wider economic and social objectives including poverty reduction.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Notwithstanding their importance in economic development, MSEs face a number of constraints including lack of access to formal financial institutions. Under the Banking and Financial Institutions Act of 1991, banks must follow prudential guidelines issued by the Bank of Tanzania (BOT) that limit credit extension to MSEs. In particular, a loan is only considered as secured if it is backed by collateral with a market value of 125% of the loan size. Unsecured lending must not exceed 5% of the lending institutions core capital. Other reasons that hinder access to formal banking facilities include high transaction costs when dealing with MSEs, existence of weak credit repayment culture, and lack of experience in micro-finance. However, informal and semi formal financial institutions have attempted to fill the gap in the provision of micro-finance services to MSEs in Tanzania.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      There are limitations to the success of informal and semi-formal financial institutions in delivering credit to MSEs. Most credit schemes have been characterized by inefficient financial intermediation such that when they try to implement different versions of lending arrangements, they often impose high transaction costs on either lenders or borrowers or both thus have limited potential for becoming sustainable. Programme viability hinges on the determinants and consequences of transaction costs in such credit schemes, and the ability of economic agents to assess such costs prior to incurring them.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Problem Statement and Significance of the Study</h3>
    <p>
      The problem of financing micro and small-scale enterprises is not a new one. Indeed providing credit to MSEs has been a major concern both of governments and donors, not only in Sub-Saharan Africa, but also in Asia and elsewhere. The majority of MSEs cannot afford to adequately finance their production activities. In Tanzania, a number of local and externally funded agencies have been involved in micro-finance activities through projects usually targeting at a specific group, such as women, youth or the poor. The number of micro-finance institutions has increased substantially since the beginning of economic reforms. However, over the years, lessons learnt from the different credit schemes has been that development objectives have often been more important than instilling sustainable financial management mechanisms and most of these schemes have been characterized by inefficient financial intermediation.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      For efficient financial intermediation, an understanding of the determinants and consequences of transaction costs in credit demand and repayment is of paramount importance. The amount of transaction costs and the way in which they are shared tells a great deal about how financial markets perform. These costs also reveal how intermediaries react to regulations (Adams and Vogel, 1986). However, previous studies on credit issues in Tanzania, for example Kashuliza and Kydd (1996), Mwachang'a (2000), have taken the conventional view of financing in Least Developed Countries, which gives special importance to the number of loans, the volume of credit disbursed and repayment rates, as key elements of success. Few (if any) recent studies have provided detailed empirical evidence on the nature and implications of loan transaction costs.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      A clear understanding of lending and borrowing costs is an indispensable element of credit policies since they impact on the sustainability of lending programmes. This study therefore will aim at determining the extent to which reduced transaction costs can be exploited in Tanzania. In particular it will focus on MSEs credit schemes in Arusha and Mwanza districts. Critical policy questions are what factors affect the transaction costs incurred by borrowers, what are the consequences of transaction costs on credit demand, and how can transaction costs be accounted for in the design of the different lending programmes.

    <br />

    <h3>Literature Review</h3>
    <h4>The Concept of Transaction Cost</h4>
    <p>
      The notion that the cost of arranging an exchange may reduce or even prevent exchanges from occurring is now widely accepted (Staal et al, 1996). Thus, transaction costs broadly refer to the costs involved in exchange. They are costs that prevent markets from operating efficiently or factors that may prevent exchanges from taking place (Gamin, 1994). Transaction costs include; the cost of searching for a partner with whom to exchange, screening potential trading partners to ascertain their trustworthiness, bargaining with potential trading partners to reach an agreement, transferring the product, monitoring the agreement to see that its conditions are fulfilled, and enforcing (or seeking damages for any violation of) the exchange agreement (Staal et al, 1996).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Coase (1991) as cited by Rindfleisch and Heide (1997), proposes that under certain conditions, the cost of conducting economic exchange in a market may exceed the costs of organizing the exchange within the firm. In this context, transaction costs are the "costs of running the system" and include such ex ante costs as drafting and negotiating contracts and such ex post costs as monitoring and enforcing agreements. Over the past decade, Transaction Cost Analysis (TCA) has received an increased amount of attention from a broad range of audiences (Bjuggren, 1985; Pollak, 1985; Rindfleisch and Heide, 1997). Evidence of this attention takes many forms, the most visible being the Nobel award in Economics given to Ronald Coase for his work on transaction costs (Coase, 1991). Although most strongly advocated by economists, TCA has generated considerable interest in other academic disciplines beyond economics, including sociology, political science, organisation theory, contract law, business strategy and marketing (Rindfleisch and Heide, 1997).
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Transaction Costs in Financial Intermediation</h4>
    <p>
      In recent years, awareness has grown of the costs involved in financial intermediation (Mittendorf, 1986). The cost of lending and borrowing strongly determine whether the financial institutions can engage in finance and whether the population can successfully access the formal capital market (Adams and Vogel, 1986, Adams et al, 1984, World Bank, 1990a). Credit or capital markets come into being and evolve as a result of financial innovations that tend to reduce the total risk premium and total transaction costs, to a level that is mutually acceptable to both lenders and borrowers (Bhatt, 1988). To be effective, an innovation should have risk reducing effect much greater than its cost increasing effect.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Lender Transaction Costs</h4>
    <p>
      The resources used for transactions by financial market participants are important measures of performance (Adams and Vogel, 1986). Like well-oiled machines, financial markets that perform with little friction create few transaction costs for participants. Transaction costs for lenders include; expenses of mobilising funds for on-lending, costs of collecting information about potential borrowers, and costs of extending, maintaining and collecting loans (Adams et al, 1995). The administration costs of lending to small farmers (not counting the cost of capital) often run between 10 and 30 percent of the loan and sometimes even more (World Bank, 1975). Loan recovery problems, combined with relatively large transaction costs, have sometimes caused lenders to collapse (Adams and Vogel 1986). The need for innovation and new technology to reduce transaction costs is urgent. Olomola and Mahawonku (1993), in their study on the role and determinants of lending transaction costs, found out that lending costs were determined mainly by the borrowers' distance from the loan office and the size of the loan disbursed. The costs were found to be a decreasing function of loan amount and an increasing function of the borrowers' distance from the loan office. Also, total lending transaction costs in the particular study, constituted about 6 percent of the loan disbursed and about 70 percent of the nominal interest rate; with the recovery cost being the highest component followed by monitoring and processing costs respectively.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Sustainability requires that financial institutions and programs be financially viable. The most appropriate quantitative indicator is the subsidy dependency index (Yaron, 1992a). However, because accounting data may be lacking for most of the institutions, other factors may indirectly indicate, to some extent, whether institutions operate in a cost-covering way. These include; subsidisation level, administrative costs which largely entail transaction costs, loan recovery rates, length of operations, growth and diversification of activities, and the source and cost of funds (Yaron, 1992b).
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Borrower Transaction Costs</h4>
    <p>
      Borrower transaction costs mainly involve various charges imposed by lenders beyond interest payments such as application fees, service fees and travel expenses. Lost time from work is an important part of the transaction costs for most poor borrowers. High transaction costs of borrowing from formal sources discourage small entrepreneurs from availing themselves of formal credit. In this case, the market fails from the demand side (Gamin, 1994). Borrowers of small amounts and individuals, who do not have prior borrowing experience with a prospective lender, may incur relatively large transaction costs to acquire a loan. Adams and Nehman (1978), identifies at least three kinds of borrower transaction costs. These include:
    </p>
    <ul style={{marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
      <li>Loan charges collected by the lender beyond interest payments, through such things as application fees, bribes, compensatory balances and closing costs. The lender may also raise the borrowers' transaction costs by deducting interest charges in advance or collecting interest on the entire loan, though the borrower withdraws only part.</li>
      <li>In many low-income countries the poor may be forced to negotiate with someone outside the formal lending agency before a loan application is formally received. This individual may be a local government official or leader, or a co-signer. In some cases a potential borrower must pay expenses for a technician to visit and inventory borrower's operations. Gifts and bribes may be involved in some of these cases.</li>
      <li>In many cases, the largest and most important transaction costs are the borrower's time and travel expenses involved in the loan transaction. Many small and new borrowers are required to visit the formal lender a number of times to negotiate the loan, withdraw portion of the loan, and make repayment. Some of these visits may involve waiting in line for long periods and traveling long distances. Lost work time may be quite important especially when the opportunity costs of the borrower's time are substantial.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>
      The borrower loan transaction costs, detailed in a study by Shahjahan and others, in early 1960s in Bangladesh (Adams and Nehman, 1978), included; application fees, form filling fees, costs of "entertaining" people who assisted in getting the loan, and the opportunity cost of the borrower's time used in negotiating the loan. In a 1971 study, Nehman (cited by Adams and Nehman, 1978), analysed borrowing costs by the state of Sao Paulo, in Brazil. The borrowers loan transaction costs included loan registration fees, appraisal costs covered by the potential borrower, and the borrower's time and travel costs involved in negotiating, acquiring and repaying the loan. As in the Bangladesh study, Nehman found out that for most small and new borrowers, the time lost in negotiating loans made up a very large part of total borrower's transaction cost, even when the borrower's time was valued at day labour wages. In a study conducted in Philippines on borrower transaction cost and credit rationing in rural financial markets, Guia-Abiad (1991), found borrower transaction costs to be an important determinant of loan demand, confirming the expected inverse relationship between the two variables. On the other hand, the levels of transaction costs were found to be determined by two factors: distance to the bank and type of bank. The further the bank from the borrower's residence, the higher the transaction costs. Borrowers of rural banks also had higher transaction costs than borrowers from non-rural banks.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The most important conclusion from the above studies is that borrower loan transaction costs above and beyond nominal interest payments may be an important factor discouraging small and new borrowers from using formal loans. These loan transaction costs appear to make up a very large part of borrowing costs for many small and medium sized borrowers. The borrowing transaction costs largely govern the debtors credit demand (Jenicek and Shaba, 1998). In fact, Desai and Mellor (1993) show in their review that the loan demand coefficient is negative but inelastic, regarding the interest rate.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Study Methodology</h3>
    <h4>Conceptual Framework</h4>
    <p>
      Transaction costs in credit delivery can be conceptualized as costs incurred by lenders and borrowers during pre-loan disbursement, loan disbursement and post-loan disbursement activities. For lenders, these may include costs associated with searching for loanable funds, designing credit contracts, engaging in community outreach and screening of borrowers, assessing project feasibility, evaluating loan applications, providing credit training to staff and borrowers, and monitoring and enforcing loan contracts. For borrowers, these may include costs associated with screening potential group members, group formation, agreeing on formal or informal group rules, negotiating with the lender, filling out necessary paperwork, transport to and from the lender, time spent on group activities related to attaining access to credit, and enforcing group rules. Figure 1, details the transaction responsibilities of lenders and borrowers in the three stages of credit delivery.

    <h4>Study Area</h4>
    <p>
      This research study will be conducted in two districts, which are Mwanza and Arusha.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Sources of Data</h4>
    <p>
      The data used in this study will be largely cross-sectional, obtained from primary sources (MSEs and credit schemes). Secondary sources from the selected lending institutions and other sources will also be used to provide background information for the study. The process of data collection from primary sources will involve pre-testing the questionnaire during a preliminary survey to be conducted, sample selection, interviewing the sampled MSEs and selected financial institutions. Details on the data collection procedures are described in subsequent sections.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4><em>Borrowers Questionnaire</em></h4>
    <p>
      The questionnaire is designed to capture both quantitative and qualitative data. The questionnaire will contain seven sections. Section one, designed to capture information on the general characteristics of the respondent. Section two, meant to collect information on credit received by the borrowers from the lending programmes and associated costs (as stipulated in section 6.4.3). Section three for information on assets and loan securities owned by the borrowers, while section four is designed to obtain borrowers' assessment of the benefits obtained from the credit schemes. Section five, designed to collect information on other sources of credit available to MSEs whilst section six is intended to collect information on interest rate and repayment performance of borrower groups. The last section seeks general comments from the respondents on the credit programmes.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4><em>Check List for Lenders</em></h4>
    <p>
      A checklist will be used to interview the lending programmes whereby questions leading to estimation of lending transaction costs (as stipulated in 6.4.2) will be asked. Hence data for measuring lending transaction costs will be collected.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4><em>Pre-survey</em></h4>
    <p>
      Prior to the main survey, a pre-survey will be conducted. This is essential, as it will enable the researchers to pre-test the questionnaire and to ascertain the feasibility of conducting the major survey in the intended areas of study. Questionnaire pre-testing will be conducted using a small sample of at least 20 MSEs in each district.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4><em>Sample Selection Techniques</em></h4>
    <p>
      The research will cover at least five divisions from each of the two districts (Mwanza and Arusha). From a list of MSEs in the divisions, the researcher will purposefully select a total of 12 MSEs. Sample MSEs will be identified primarily from the credit lending point of view. MSEs, which did not borrow from credit schemes during the calendar year 2001 will be excluded from the sample. In total, the sample size will be 60 MSEs for each district making a total of 120 sample MSEs for the entire study.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4><em>Questionnaire Administration</em></h4>
    <p>
      The researchers, with the help of enumerators, will administer the questionnaire.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Data Analysis</h4>
    <p>
      Data analysis will be conducted using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) program. Much of the analysis will be based on descriptive statistics to summarize survey results. However, econometric models will also be employed to examine socio-economic variables influencing borrowing transaction costs, credit demand and the influence of transaction costs on repayment rate.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Econometric Models</h4>
    <p>
      In this section, the conceptual framework structured and described, earlier is operationalised by specifying the relationship between (i) borrowing transaction costs and factors hypothesized to influence them, (ii) and demand for credit and transaction costs.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4><em>Factors Influencing Borrowing Transaction Costs</em></h4>
    <p>
      Variations in loan transaction costs could be determined by a number of factors such as the amount of loan obtained, distance to the lending institution, borrower experience, disbursement lag and opportunity cost of labour for work time lost. A Cobb-Douglas model will be used to examine the relationship between these factors and borrowing transaction costs and estimated using OLS regression technique.
    </p>
    <p>
      LnBTCOST = LnB0 – B1LnLOAN + B2LnDISTANCE + B3LnDISLAG – B4LnBOREX + B5LnTIME + B6LnGSIZE + u
    </p>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul style={{marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
      <li>BTCOST = Borrowing transaction cost (Tsh)</li>
      <li>LOAN = Amount of loan obtained by a farmer (Tsh)</li>
      <li>DISTANCE = Distance of borrower from loan office (Km)</li>
      <li>BOREX = Borrowing experience, which is a dummy variable with a value of unity for experienced borrowers and zero for first-time borrowers</li>
      <li>DISLAG = Loan disbursement lag, defined as the time-interval between submission of loan application and collection of the loan (days)</li>
      <li>TIME = Time spent on loan activities. This reflects the opportunity cost of labour for borrower's lost work time (days)</li>
      <li>GPSIZE = Number of members for each borrower group</li>
      <li>B0 = Constant term</li>
      <li>u = Error term</li>
      <li>Bis (i=1,…, 4) = Parameters which when estimated can be interpreted directly as elasticities.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />

    <h4><em>Demand for Credit</em></h4>
    <p>
      The demand for credit was hypothesized to be determined by the interest charges, borrower transaction costs as a percentage of loan amount received, number of household members, years of schooling of household head, access to other credit sources, distance to loan office, borrower experience and disbursement lag. The loan demand equation is specified as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      lnLOAN = c0 – c1lnBTCOST – c2lnDISTANCE + c3lnEDCN – c4lnOTHSCS + c5lnBOREX – c6lnDISLAG + u
    </p>
    <p>Where:</p>
    <ul style={{marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
      <li>LOAN = Loan amount applied for</li>
      <li>BTCOST = Borrower transaction costs as a percentage of loan amount received</li>
      <li>EDCN = Years of schooling of household head</li>
      <li>OTHSCS = Dummy variable for access to other sources of credit with a value of 1 if a borrower has also borrowed from other sources and 0 if otherwise.</li>
      <li>BOREX = Borrower experience, dummy variable with a value of 1 for experienced borrowers and 0 for first time borrowers</li>
      <li>DISLAG = Disbursement lag (Days)</li>
      <li>DISTANCE = Distance (km) between borrowers and loan office</li>
      <li>u = Error term</li>
      <li>cis(i=1,…,4) = Parameters which when estimated can be interpreted directly as elasticities.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Loan amount applied for is used as a dependent variable, because the amount eligibility depends on the frequency of borrowing, whereby the higher the frequency the higher is the amount one can borrow.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Estimation of Lending Transaction Costs</h4>
    <p>
      Lending transaction costs arise from group mobilization, evaluating loan applications, monitoring loan performance of borrowers, collecting loans, managing delinquencies and giving technical assistance to entrepreneurs. There are three major components of lending transaction costs. These are:
    </p>
    <ul style={{marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
      <li>Loan processing costs, which include, the sum of travel expenses, cost of stationery and the value of staff time spent on inspection visits before loan is approved</li>
      <li>Monitoring costs, which entails the value of staff time spent in visiting a particular borrower after loan disbursement, but before repayment was due, plus travel expenses</li>
      <li>Loan recovery costs, which comprise of travel expenses associated with loan recovery visits to and from a particular borrower plus value of staff time involved.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Value of staff time is obtained as a product of the following variables; Number of visits, hours of visits and number of staff and their salary levels. Costs incurred in executing the above activities include; fuel for programme vehicles, allowances for programme staff, and allowances for other participants in the case of meetings and workshops.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Three alternative measures of average costs will be computed. The first will be cost per borrower, the second, cost as percentage of loan and the third, cost as percentage of nominal interest rate. This will be achieved by dividing the total transaction costs by the number of loans, amount (value) of loans and the nominal rate of interest respectively. The above approach implicitly assumes that loan transaction costs incurred in a particular year occurred as a result of only the loans made in that year; thereby disregarding the influence on cost of previous years loans still in the portfolio. A corollary to this assumption is that the costs of a loan should be charged to the period during which the loan was made.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      The bias that may be introduced in these estimates of average costs based on the above assumption becomes less important in this particular case, because the bias tends to be larger the faster the loan portfolio is growing and the larger the share of medium and long term loans in the portfolio. The average cost estimates are, however, important because by comparing the average costs of the two programs with that of other credit programs, one can form a judgment about the efficiency of the two programmes relative to their credit facilities.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Estimation of Borrowing Transaction Costs</h4>
    <p>
      Borrower transaction costs will be computed by considering cash outlay incurred and the opportunity cost of time spent by borrowers on activities directly related to acquiring access to loan. The cash outlay consist of the transportation expenses and administration costs which include membership fees, accommodation and meals expenses, incurred in the process of applying, receiving and repaying loans by each borrower. The opportunity cost of labour for work time lost will be valued at a day labour wage at the borrowers' localities.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Like the estimation of lending transaction costs, three alternative measures of average borrowing transaction costs will be computed. The first is cost per borrower, the second, cost as percentage of loan and the third, cost as percentage of nominal interest rate. This will be achieved by dividing total transaction costs by the number of loans, amount (value) of loans and the nominal rate of interest, respectively.
    </p>
    <br />
