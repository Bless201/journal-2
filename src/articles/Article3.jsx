    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p className="abstract">This paper is concerned with difficulties associated with the allocation of support teaching to inclusive primary schools. It proposes an alternative system called 'naming'. This involves specific procedures for the identification of children most in need and the negotiation of a contract between a learning support service and a child's parents. While acknowledging some defects in the procedures outlined, it is maintained that it is quicker, more flexible and cost effective.</p>

    <h3>Introduction: Problems arising from the 2001 Education Act</h3>
    <p>Most commentators have welcome some aspects of the 2001 Education Act—it gave greater accountability to parents, for example. However, there are problems with the way in which the Act has been implemented for pupils in inclusive schools with learning difficulties:</p>
    
    <ol style={{marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
      <li>Statement provision as a way of providing for the immediate needs of children has a major drawback because the formal assessment process may take several months. Whilst it may be argued that this facilitates a long-term, methodical analysis of pupils' difficulties, it does not necessarily provide help to those children with more straightforward problems who need resources quickly.</li>
      
      <li>Allied to this point is the fact that statutory assessments are expensive, due to their intensive use of professional time (for example, that of educational psychologists, head-teachers and medical officers) and excessive administration costs. The more money that is tied up in these processes, the less there is available for the actual provision of teaching resources.</li>
      
      <li>The statutory assessment process is stressful for parents. The skills of compassionate professionals can help parents cope with the paperwork involved, but the fact remains that a range of possible provision and legal responsibilities must be explained to parents and this can easily lead to worry and confusion.</li>
      
      <li>By charging local education authorities (LEAs) with the duty to assess pupils with special needs, the 2001 Act takes responsibility for assessment away from the school. When a change of school is being considered perhaps this is appropriate, but for those pupils who simply need more resources in school then there seems little sense in reducing the role of on-going, daily school-based assessment of performance.</li>
      
      <li>Similarly, the statement review system doesn't allow for detailed programme setting in response to variable pupil performance. By default, reviews are held annually, whereas it might be argued that demands change more frequently.</li>
      
      <li>LEAs, who must fund statements, do not have bottomless purses. Money is rarely an issue for parents and professionals, who are led to believe that they are making recommendations about the pupil independent of financial considerations. In the end, however, decisions about whether to make a statement, and what resources are required, will not be allowed to bankrupt an education department, but this is not made clear to parents.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Problems associated with learning support</h3>
    <p>The difficulties listed above associated with the implementation of the 2001 Act are by no means unique to Dudley. There were, however, some problems which did seem to be more localised:</p>
    
    <ol style={{marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
      <li>Schools in the borough have always been richly served by a peripatetic learning support service (LSS). When the number of school-based statements of special needs increased, the LEA decided to use the LSS as the statemented provision. This decreased the amount of routine support available to schools on an informal basis.</li>
      
      <li>For both statemented and non-statemented LSS provision, the goals of an intervention were not always made clear and agreed with all parties. A statement for in-school resources might simply call for 'structured tuition in reading and writing' and for a non-statemented pupil it might simply be arranged by the head that a pupil should 'join a withdrawal group and monitor progress'.</li>
      
      <li>For both types of interventions, there were unclear expectations over the minimum amount of support available to individual pupils in schools. It was considered that providing pupils with 15 minutes' withdrawal help in a group of eight took responsibility away from class teacher without doing much for the education of the pupils. How much help was required as a minimum, and in what form, was never clarified. Consequently, resources became stretched beyond the point where they were helpful.</li>
      
      <li>It became increasingly difficult for the LSS or the statementing administration staff to remove resources from a school once additional resources had been deployed. This meant that the levels and functions of support personnel for pupils with learning difficulties could not easily respond to changes in the difficulties faced by pupils.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Problems arising from managing special needs in school</h3>
    <p>There were also two problems associated with the allocation of responsibility in inclusive schools:</p>
    
    <ol style={{marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
      <li>Few schools had developed ways of systematically monitoring the progress of the majority of pupils with special needs—that is, those who did not receive LSS support. This often meant that when educational psychologists or LSS co-ordinators were asked for help they would find that they were the first to take any action on a problem, implying that the class teacher had not made a significant attempt to resolve the difficulty.</li>
      
      <li>Because of the overlap of responsibility, it was unclear who should keep a pupil's parents informed about what was happening to their child in school and about the involvement of external agencies.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>The Solution</h3>
    <p>To address these difficulties, a system was developed encompassing all the procedures to help pupils with learning difficulties. There are three broad stages involved:</p>
    
    <ol style={{marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
      <li>Support in school</li>
      <li>Consultation with external agencies</li>
      <li>Allocation of teaching time to the school for named pupils</li>
    </ol>
    
    <br />
    <h4>Stage 1: Support in school</h4>
    <p>At this early stage responsibility for meeting children's needs rests entirely with the school. The head-teacher is acknowledged as being fully responsible for pupils' general education, assessment and record keeping. Initially, class teachers are expected to identify pupils who are causing concern. Class teachers record the reason for concern, what interventions have been attempted and what results were achieved. A record sheet is provided by the LEA for this purpose.</p>
    <br />

    <p>If a pupil continues to be a cause for concern and the class teacher has run out of ideas about the problem, then the school's special needs co-ordinator can be consulted for advice. All primary schools have nominated a special needs co-ordinator who will be expected to work with class teachers to help develop successful strategies for children with learning difficulties. A record sheet is provided by the LEA to note the co-ordinator's advice and the effects of implementing this advice by the class teacher. The procedures make clear that parents must be consulted at this stage.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Stage 2: Consultation with the area team</h4>
    <p>Hopefully, when the class teacher implements the special needs co-ordinator's suggestions, the pupil's progress will improve to a satisfactory level. Inevitably, however, there will be occasions when problems still remain, in which case the school is able to consult the special needs area team for advice. The area team consists of an educational psychologist and the LSS co-ordinator for each part of the borough. Forms exist for requesting advice from the area team and for the response to be recorded. Again, parents must be consulted before the area team are involved.</p>
    <br />

    <p>The school remains responsible for implementing the advice received from the area team. The school staff are expected to monitor progress and report back to the area team. No additional teaching provision is available from the centrally funded LEA learning support team during this phase—the support consists of advice, follow-up and monitoring.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Termly meetings are held in each school to review pupils who have been identified as having special educational needs. The planning meetings are attended by the educational psychologist, the area co-ordinator for the LSS, and the special needs support teacher from the school. Brief minutes are circulated which specify agreed actions.</p>
    <br />
    
    <h4>Stage 3: Named child provision</h4>
    <p>Having implemented the advice from the area team, if a pupil continues to cause concern, then the school may request that the child should be 'named'. Full details of the interventions attempted by the school so far are made available to the area team who consider the request in conjunction with similar requests about other pupils in their area.</p>
    <br />

    <p>If the area team decide to prioritise the pupil's needs, then arrangements are made for the child to be named. 'Naming' consists of negotiating a contract between the LSS, the school and the child's parents. Thus, during this phase, when a pupil receives 'named child provision', responsibility for teaching is shared between the LSS, the school and (possibly) the parents. The contract should specify what support is being provided, for how long and, most importantly, for what precise purpose. Every step is taken to facilitate quality control of the additional support provided.</p>
    <br />

    <p>The number and duration of teaching sessions is specified—usually three sessions of 40 minutes by an LSS teacher are provided each week, to which the school is expected to make a comparable arrangement from its own staff resources on the remaining two days of each week. During these support sessions extra help is targeted at no more than five pupils. The content and purpose of teaching support is specified in each child's individual programme, and the input from the LSS may follow a number of models such as:</p>
    
    <ul style={{marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
      <li>Teaching support in class</li>
      <li>Withdrawal into a tutorial group</li>
      <li>Working with parents</li>
    </ul>

    <br />
    
    <p>The results achieved are discussed at the planning meeting.</p>
    
    <p>Naming contracts are not expected to run for more than six months. If it is shown that the amount of provision available for a named child is insufficient, only then may the child be recommended for a statutory assessment. Such an assessment is likely to lead to a special school placement, as the maximum amount of in-school provision available will already have been tried but proved insufficient to meet the child's needs.</p>

    <h3>Advantages of the new procedures</h3>
    <p>Perhaps the main advantage of the new procedures for parents and professionals alike is that there is a clear policy across the LEA on how resources for mainstream support should be deployed and utilised. The policy makes it clear to all involved that ultimately decisions about inclusive support are resource-led. In addition there is a requirement to set out clearly the basis on which decisions have been made.</p>
    <br />

    <p>The procedure is considerably cheaper, quicker and more flexible than 2001 Act assessment procedures. Reviews every six months and clear specification of goals allow for more detailed programme planning. The different levels of the process ensure that schools are encouraged to follow the Warnock stages of assessment.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Planning meetings provide a focus for clarifying the goals of any intervention and the responsibilities of the various professionals involved with a particular child. Precise record keeping is standardised and linked to intervention, so that assessment is primarily based on teaching. External support services do not get involved until there is evidence that the school has already made a genuine attempt to address the problem.</p>
    <br />

    <p>The special forms developed by the LEA encourage schools to adopt a problem-solving approach to pupils with special needs. The forms clarify 'who has responsibility for doing what' and their attractive appearance helps to promote a professional image to the task of managing special needs in school.</p>
    <br />

    <p>The decision to allocate additional provision is made promptly by professionals closely involved with an area, rather than by a remote figure in the town hall. Additional provision is defined exactly and closely related to educational attainments and its effects are closely monitored by centrally funded LEA staff, thus enabling some accountability to be built into the system.</p>
    <br />

    <p>The new procedures ensure that parents are more informed and involved than was the case previously. It also avoids the formality of 2001 Act assessment procedures. Now that the system is approved at all levels in the authority, the LEA can show parents clearly how they are helping their child and the routes to further help. Therefore the policy provides an effective answer to unreasonable parental requests for formal assessment. Parents' statutory rights remain unaffected, but it is unlikely that a statement will be made specifying teaching support for pupils with learning difficulties in mainstream schools.</p>

    <h3>Problems remaining</h3>
    <p>The new procedures perpetuate the idea that additional provision is based on a deficit model—that is, the more children who are perceived as 'failing', the more resources a school will receive. There is a danger that LEAs may find themselves reinforcing schools which do not make good use of their own resources to meet the needs of children with learning difficulties.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Loss of flexibility is another problem. Because learning support is now deployed in defined chunks (a number of sessions for a particular group of pupils), support staff are unable to respond to immediate, informal requests for help. As children in a particular group are not likely to be in the same class, the new procedures will tend to increase withdrawal teaching at the expense of in-class support.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Since the procedures are resource-led, it is necessary for professionals to arrive at a cut-off point which must be objective and communicable. Determination of criteria for this decision is extremely difficult but it seems likely that this increase in accountability will ultimately improve decision making.</p>
    <br />

    <p>The 2001 Act maintained a clear distinction between advice givers and resource providers. The naming procedures blur this distinction by involving educational psychologists in taking decisions on the basis of a limited budget, rather than implying that they can 'impartially' advise the LEA on the needs of particular children.</p>
    <br />

    <p>There are several practical considerations which also need to be resolved. For example:</p>
    
    <ul style={{marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
      <li>The staffing systems are not as fluid as the system would like them to be. Not only do learning support teachers prefer to remain associated with particular schools for at least a year (rather than change some of their duties on a termly basis) but also those schools are very reluctant to lose these staff, even when it can be shown that neighbouring schools have greater needs for resources.</li>
      
      <li>The contracts for individual children form the basis of the system, but who should take the time to write and distribute the paperwork has not been agreed within the LEA.</li>
      
      <li>Similarly, the time demanded of the school's special needs co-ordinator has not been agreed. Many of these people still have a full class-teaching responsibility and therefore cannot take the active role required under the naming procedures.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>It is a major step forward to have an authority-wide policy governing provision to help schools meet the needs of pupils with learning difficulties. Unfortunately, the resource-led nature of the policy has not been popular with people who hadn't realised the extent to which finance determines the level of special needs provision. This initiative makes clear the links between the resources available and the way that they are deployed—it highlights the need for high quality curriculum-related assessment data so that fair and consistent criteria can be applied across the LEA.</p>
