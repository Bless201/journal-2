    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>We may all be limited by our imaginations, but some people are able to think freshly about something and in doing so open up new possibilities for themselves and others. Imagination (to cause to come into existence) and creativity (the ability to create) are inextricably linked. Creativity involves first imagining and then working with the ideas to produce new things. It could be new knowledge, a new process, a product or a unique performance or any combination of these things. We can encourage our imaginations to think many ideas or develop the habits that limit us to working with a few ideas. The world gets ever more complex: in the words of Ron Barnett, 'higher education is faced with not just preparing students for a complex world; it is faced with preparing students for a super complex world' (Barnett, 2000). We need imagination and creativity to work with, adapt to and exploit such complexity.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Higher education is full of creative people (staff and educational developers being some of the most creative) and the professional act of teaching, with the significant autonomy attached to this role, provides fertile conditions for people to be creative in order to promote students' learning. But many of us do not take advantage of this opportunity. All too often we prefer to replicate well tried methods and designs rather than experiment with more imaginative but riskier and perhaps less comfortable ways of doing things. The constant pressure for greater efficiency in what we do combined with pressures for research output are two major inhibitors (or excuses) for the absence of experimental enterprise. Quality assurance and peer review systems that favour conservatism are others. Being professional about teaching requires us to question and challenge the methodologies we use to promote students' learning. Will traditional methods of teaching deliver the increased efficiency that is required with the increased range of abilities/aptitudes (beyond mere knowledge) now being expected? Do our methods develop the behaviours and attitudes that are necessary to survive and prosper in this world of continuous change and problem working? The world requires people to be creative in order to grow the knowledge that is necessary to sustain themselves and the social and economic enterprises they inhabit.</p>
    <br />

    <p>The LTSN Generic Centre's Imaginative Curriculum project is trying to foster the conditions for teachers and those involved in supporting curriculum development to think freshly about the curriculum, to share their experiential knowledge and to stimulate the imaginations of other teachers. Participants in the Imaginative Curriculum network share the belief that enabling students to be creative is a worthwhile and desirable educational goal that will benefit students throughout their lives and any programme can be designed to make it more favourable to nurturing creativity.</p>
    
    <h3>Teacher Conceptions of their own Creativity</h3>
    <p>Being creative is, for the most part, a subconscious act. HE teachers do not sit down to design a course and think I'm going to be creative now! But they do believe that teaching involves being creative (see the research studies of McGoldrick 2002; Tait 2002 and Oliver 2002).</p>
    <br />

    <p>Some ways in which creativity is recognised by academics designing a curriculum (Oliver 2002, McGoldrick 2002) include:</p>
    <ul style={{marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
      <li><em>creativity as personal innovation</em> — something that is new to individuals. This is often about the transfer and adaptation of ideas from one context to another;</li>
      <li><em>creativity as working at and across the boundaries of acceptability in specific contexts:</em> it involves taking risks;</li>
      <li><em>creativity as design that promotes the holistic idea of graduateness</em> —the capacity to connect and do things with what has been learnt and to utilise this knowledge to learn in other situations;</li>
      <li><em>creativity as making sense out of complexity</em> i.e. working with multiple — often conflicting — factors, pressures, interests and constraints;</li>
      <li><em>creativity as a process of narrative making</em> in order to present the 'real curriculum' in ways that conform to the regulatory expectations of how a curriculum should be framed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Creativity in students' learning</h3>
    <p>There are strong similarities between the perceptions of academics of their own creativity and what they perceive are the characteristics of creativity in students' learning. Creativity involves the extended abstract outcomes of learning (Biggs, 1999; 2002) like hypothesizing, synthesizing, reflecting, generating ideas, applying the known to 'far' domains, working with problems that do not have unique solutions. The capacity to connect ideas and create evaluative frameworks to judge the value of ideas and potential solutions are essential features of academic creativity. The Imaginative Curriculum project has the potential to make an important contribution to understanding the nature of creativity in students' learning in different learning contexts.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Creative performance also requires positive attitudes and high levels of motivation (passion) evidenced by persistence and willingness to work hard. Such attitudes derive from personal beliefs that obstacles can be overcome. So learning processes to foster creativity must develop self-confidence and self-esteem, encourage by not penalizing risk-taking in relatively safe environments and help students to be 'comfortable' in messy/complex and unpredictable situations where there are no right and wrong answers. Working with complexity in a self-sustained and determined way is a fact of life and helping students to learn in complex unpredictable situations must be a worthwhile and appropriate enterprise for higher education. Such beliefs connect us to the fundamental moral purpose of education — making a difference to students' lives.</p>
    <br />

    <p>While different disciplines recognize and value different forms of creativity, research studies recognize a range of intellectual attributes, attitudes and behaviours associated with creativity. DeWulf and Baillie (1999 p14-15) identify three characteristics:</p>
      
    <ul style={{marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
      <li>ability<strong> to visualise ideas</strong> — holistically, spatially, metaphorically and to be able to transform ideas through imaginative manipulation (complimentary reasoning, McKim, 1980). Flexibility, fluency and adaptability are important to the transformation of ideas.</li>
      <li><strong>effective use of memory</strong> — for previously learnt knowledge and the ability to make connections and associations with and through this knowledge.</li>
      <li><strong>convergent and divergent thinking</strong> — academic ways of thinking tend to value convergent ways of thinking — logic, reasoning, analysis, objectivity, judgement (left brain thinking — McKim, 1980). Divergent thinking brings into play the right brain thinking which is associated with openness, subjectivity, feeling, intuition, emotion, sensory and imaginative processes (McKim, 1980). Convergent thinking focuses on one answer while divergent thinking produces alternative possibilities and solutions. Creativity involves both convergent thinking (focused, analytical, judgemental and detailed thinking) and divergent thinking (diffuse, free flowing, associated, perceptual and imaginative). Training in creative thinking techniques such as those described by DeWulf and Baillie (1999) can help foster the habit of thinking in both divergent and convergent modes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Course designs as a means of sharing and stimulating imaginations</h3>
    <p>DeWulf and Baillie (1999) offer a definition of creativity as 'shared imaginations.' Unpacking this further it involves firstly having your own imagination, then doing something useful with it (sharing it) and perhaps encouraging others to use their own imaginations (the process of sparking each other!). The idea of shared imaginations is an attractive conception for the curriculum context as teachers' course and module designs provide the vehicle for sharing the imaginations of the designer and provide prompts and stimuli for further creative action by the teachers who operationalise the designs. Indeed, the real act of creativity for most teachers is in making a rudimentary design come alive through the teaching process.</p>
     <br />

    <p>These abstract ideas are all well and good but what practical things can we do to nurture students' (and for that matter teachers') creativity? Any programme can be designed or redesigned to make it more favourable to nurturing creativity and developing the habits of thinking creatively (Knight 2002). The following points (adapted and developed from Knight 2002 and Jackson 2002b) provide some guiding principles for helping teachers to develop their capacity to help students learn more creatively and to designing a curriculum that nurtures creativity.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Teacher conceptions of teaching and learning:</h4>
    <p>We are enabled or stopped from doing things by the conceptions and perceptions (imaginations!) we hold. Conceptions and perceptions that support creativity in students' learning view teaching as a learning process itself and the role of the teacher is to engage students actively in challenging learning processes and help them create their own processes and frameworks for working with 'problems.' Teaching strategies foster students' intrinsic motivations for learning that derive more from the pleasure of interesting challenges than from the threat of assessment. Teacher conceptions must also value the idea that we can learn through systematic reflection in order to optimise the potential for learning from any situation — even those that don't go the way they are expected.</p>

      <br/>
     <p>John Biggs identifies 3 levels of thinking about teaching in terms of what is focused upon (Biggs 1999, chapter 4). At level 1 the focus is on what the student is, at level 2 the focus is on what the teacher does and at level 3 the focus is on what the student does. Teachers who are likely to be most sympathetic to fostering creativity in students' learning are likely to be thinking in ways that are consistent with the second and third levels — what do I need to do to promote this type of learning and what do students need to do to learn this way? Houghton (2002) added a fourth level called 'how the student manages what the student does', initially within frameworks created by the teacher, but ultimately negotiating or creating his/her own framework. This conception supports habits of self-regulated learning (Zimmerman 2000). The inference is that an expanded commitment to nurturing creativity will only occur if teacher perceptions of teaching and learning embrace these higher order and increasingly sophisticated conceptions.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Sharing understandings and conceptions:</h4>
    <p>Designing a curriculum to support creativity in students' learning works best when teaching teams develop a shared understanding of the different meanings of creativity for the particular learning contexts. In reaching an understanding it is helpful to examine what teachers understand by creativity. Subject benchmarking statements rarely mention creativity so there is plenty of scope for discussion within disciplinary communities.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Developing the knowledge and skills of teachers:</h4>
    <p>Helping students to be creative requires particular facilitation skills and the adoption of a collaborative pedagogic model. Building the knowledge and capacity for this type of teaching is an essential step in the development process. Growing knowledge that will help teachers and those who develop teaching to be more knowledgeable about the ways in which creativity in student learning can be nurtured, is the central concern of the Imaginative Curriculum project.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Mapping what already exists:</h4>
    <p>Most programmes will contain within them opportunities for students to work in creative ways. Making these opportunities explicit and understanding the nature of the creative processes within these opportunities is a necessary first step in designing for creativity. When the mapping is completed additional ways and strategies in which creativity might be fostered can be considered.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Progression to independence:</h4>
    <p>Nurturing creativity requires teachers to respect the goals, motivations for learning and decision making processes of learners. This way of thinking is consistent with the idea of enabling learners to become autonomous and self-regulating. A well designed curriculum will prepare students for learning creatively, equip them with a range of tools and encourage them to use and adapt these tools and work towards independence. Zimmerman's (2000) notion of self-regulated learning provides a good theoretical model on which to develop teacher conceptions and practice.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Openness to choice and negotiation:</h4>
    <p>Teachers introduce the tools — concepts, strategies, information sources — and then have students practise them on problems and situations that they choose/identify. This requires teachers to be flexible and adaptable in their approach and to facilitate students' decision making. These characteristics of learning are also consistent with Zimmerman's model for self-regulated learning.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Novel tasks:</h4>
    <p>Students' learning is facilitated through tasks that promote divergent thinking and require them to draw from their learning in several modules and allow a variety of acceptable/appropriate/valid responses. Teachers might find themselves considering the plausibility of the solution and then awarding marks on the basis of students' accounts of their problem-working strategies. (NB. It is not a good idea to automatically join the phrase 'problem solving' with 'creativity'. The first is often convergent, the other employs both divergent and convergent thinking. Creative thinking techniques which promote both divergent and convergent thinking can be used to bridge the gap, Baillie in press).</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Developing students' knowledge about creative learning processes:</h4>
    <p>If students understand the 'rules of the game' and why the programme is as it is, then they are better placed to reflect and enter into the spirit of the creativity game. The development of skills in creative thinking are particularly important in enabling students to think freshly and differently about their problem working situations (DeWulf and Baillie 1999).</p>
    <br />

    <h4>An emphasis on learning for understanding rather than learning for extensive content mastery:</h4>
    <p>There is evidence that an emphasis on coverage encourages superficiality. Superficiality is not conducive to creativity. Understanding, which comes from covering less ground with more emphasis on the underlying concepts, strategies and assumptions, is conducive to creativity. Put it another way: cover less material but in ways that help students to understand more about the domain and its complex learning outcomes and their own engagement with the learning process. They might also approach problem working using creative thinking techniques which encourage divergent rather than convergent ways of thinking. The learning outcomes for creative learning are those used for extended understanding (Biggs 2002): being able to go beyond what has been taught; deal creatively with new situations; apply to novel contexts; hypothesize; reflect; connect and associate; generate ideas; and evaluate/judge the worth of ideas. Learning outcomes will also value the process of learning and recognise students' own unique outcomes and more general outcomes that were not planned or anticipated.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Knowledge and capability/learning transfer:</h4>
    <p>Being able to use knowledge, skill and behaviours developed in one context in another context is an important ingredient for creativity (Gardner 1993). The ways of thinking outlined above are important in the transfer of knowledge as well as the generation of knowledge. Encouraging learning that involves such behaviours is more likely to be achieved in situations that are experienced as novel and unpredictable to learners. This is what people encounter in real life and they can be simulated in the HE curriculum.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Personal accounts of learning to promote reflection and further learning:</h4>
    <p>The capacity to record, describe and evidence learning and the process of learning are central to metacognition. They encourage learners to recognise their own learning as it emerges and to make claims to understanding and achievement. There is a clear relationship with this aspect of creativity and personal development planning (Jackson 2002a). Teacher perceptions of their own learning are important here. Encouraging teachers to see the value of creating personal accounts of their own teaching process in order to reflect on and understand more deeply how process-based learning actually works is perhaps necessary in order to change belief systems that are not sympathetic to this way of learning (see Jackson 2003c for an example of a simple framework for recording teaching). Teacher participation in the construction and sharing of their own accounts of learning provides good role models for students.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Openness to innovation and change:</h4>
    <p>Possibilities for change need to be designed into the module from the beginning so that teachers and students can respond to what emerges from the process.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Assessment:</h4>
    <p>The current assessment model with its atomised approach to assessing learning at module/curriculum unit level is a major inhibitor of designs for creative learning which may need to foster development over a longer period of time and a range of contexts before assessing capability. The idea of synoptic assessments that enable students to draw together and apply their learning throughout a course (such as final level projects and dissertations) provides important opportunities for students to demonstrate their creativity. Strategies that require students to reveal their understanding of how they have acquired core learning outcomes from a course (e.g. through reflective report or portfolio) offers students another way of demonstrating their unique creativity.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Student instrumentalism driven by the teachers' belief that students only learn when they are assessed inhibits creativity. Narrow, summative-driven assessment practices and criteria that focus on what is known, which do not recognise the process of learning and how people come to know, or recognise emergent unanticipated learning outcomes, will smother creativity.</p>

    <h3>Processes that foster creativity</h3>
    <p>Many of the characteristics of designs for creative learning are those found in learning strategies that are process-based i.e. in which the process of learning is as important as the results of learning. Our emerging notion of an imaginative curriculum that nurtures and enhances students' creativity is one that is rich in the experiences of learning. Such learning environments are process-rich rather than being overloaded with content. They move away from teacher directed classroom situations and embrace more facilitated and collaborative models of teaching and learning. They work towards enabling students to be self-directing, self-regulating and resourceful learners. They give them space to learn through the experience and processes of learning. To achieve this condition students have to be properly prepared and supported. They need to acquire the habits and behaviours and self-awareness of self-regulated learners (Zimmerman 2000). Self-regulated learning involves self-determined processes and associated beliefs that initiate change and sustain learning in different contexts. It is fundamentally linked to:</p>

    <ul style={{marginLeft: '20px'}}>
      <li><strong>Metacognitive processes</strong> such as planning, organizing, self-instructing, self-monitoring and self-evaluating one's efforts to learn;</li>
      <li><strong>behavioural processes</strong> such as selecting, structuring, and creating environments for learning;</li>
      <li><strong>processes and beliefs that motivate self-regulated people to learn</strong> — such as beliefs about their own capabilities to learn, beliefs that the outcomes of learning will be worthwhile, intrinsic interest in the task and satisfaction or dissatisfaction with their own efforts to learn.</li>
    </ul>
    <br />
    <p>Personal development planning is underpinned by the model of self-regulated learning (Jackson 2003c) and it is possible that this scientific theory of learning can be extended to other forms of process-based learning. There are a rich variety of learning processes and curriculum designs that provide experiences of learning in novel and emergent situations including — problem-based, enquiry-led, work-based, context-based, collaborative learning, game-play, role-play and simulations (Boyle and Smith 2002, Ellington 2002, Newman in press, O'Rourke and Kahn in press). There are also examples emerging of these processes being connected through the strategic process of personal development planning (Maggi Boyle University of Leeds personal communication). There are also lots of opportunities for experiential learning outside the formal curriculum and the academic curriculum for example through work experience, work placements, study abroad and learning in the community. Again PDP can be used as a tool for supporting, recognising and valuing this type of learning.</p>
    <br />

    <p>But it is not enough to have rich imaginations. Ultimately, we need the enthusiasm, commitment, skills and courage of teachers who are willing to experiment, take risks and translate their imaginations into creative learning experiences for their students.</p>

    <h3>Sense of direction</h3>
    <p>These emergent ideas on process-based learning provide us with a sense of direction. We are currently producing a number of curriculum guides which will be available through a dedicated web site <strong>www.surrey.ac.uk/Education/ic/1.htm</strong>. Our intention is to work towards a conference to share ideas about process-based learning and ways of nurturing students' creativity early in 2004. If you would like to contribute ideas or examples of courses that involve process-based learning, or you have an idea for a curriculum guide please contact the author at the LTSN Generic Centre.</p>
