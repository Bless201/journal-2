    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p className="abstract">
      The classification of bowling actions in cricket is particularly important
      from an injury perspective. Research has consistently shown that bowlers
      with a mixed-action technique have an elevated risk of sustaining serious
      lumbar injury. In this study, 34 New Zealand bowlers (mean age 22.2 ¬± 0.9
      years) of premier competition standard and above were assessed using a
      three-dimensional motion analysis system (240 Hz). Data were analysed
      using three previous classification systems before classifying bowlers
      into the side-on, semi-open, front-on, and mixed-action types based on a
      modified set of angle threshold criteria and a more intuitive angle
      convention system. The majority of bowlers in the sample (64.7%) used the
      mixed action with high levels of shoulder counter-rotation. The strongest
      predictors of shoulder counter-rotation were shoulder alignment angle and
      pelvic‚Äìshoulder separation angle. The current results suggest that a large
      proportion of fast bowlers may be at a higher risk of lumbar injury from
      the use of the mixed-action technique. We believe it may be advisable to
      recommend the semi-open action as an alternative to the front-on action.
      In addition, the adopted angle convention is more practical than the
      previous convention for bowling action classification.

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      The classification of bowling actions in cricket is important,
      particularly from a coaching perspective. Bowlers can use a side-on,
      semi-open, front-on, or mixed action (National Cricket Academy, 2009;
      Portus, Mason, Elliott, Pfitzner, & Done, 2004). Each of these actions has
      distinctly different kinematic properties, such as shoulder alignment,
      pelvic alignment, and run-up speed (Bartlett, Stockill, Elliott, &
      Burnett, 1996). The general consensus is that the side-on, semi-open, and
      front-on actions are relatively safe and effective bowling techniques. The
      mixed action is associated with an elevated risk of lumbar injury (Burnett
      et al., 1996; Hardcastle, 1991; Portus et al., 2004), although this
      association may be restricted to younger bowling populations (Elliott,
      Davis, Khangure, & Hardcastle, 1993; Portus, Galloway, Elliott, & Lloyd,
      2007; Stretch, 1995). The mixed-action technique has been classified in
      terms of shoulder counter-rotation (i.e. the maximum amount of rotation of
      the rear shoulder away from the batter in the transverse plane during the
      delivery stride) and pelvis-shoulder separation angle (Burnett, Elliott, &
      Marshall, 1995; Elliott et al., 1993; Portus et al., 2004).</p> 
      <br />

      <p>Researchers
      have proposed a variety of threshold criteria to formally classify these
      bowling actions. Elliott et al. (1993) defined: (i) a side-on action when
      the shoulder alignment is less than or equal to 190¬∞ with the back foot
      angle at contact equal to or less than 280¬∞; (ii) a front-on action when
      the shoulder alignment is greater than 190¬∞ with the back foot angle
      greater than 280¬∞; and (iii) a mixed action when the shoulder alignment is
      greater than 190¬∞ and shoulder counter-rotation is greater than 100¬∞.
      Burnett et al. (1995) proposed a similar convention system, but removed
      the back foot angle criterion, used a shoulder alignment of 200¬∞ to
      differentiate between the side-on and front-on actions, and specified more
      than 200¬∞ of both pelvis-shoulder angle separation and counter-rotation to
      classify a mixed action. Portus and colleagues (Portus, Sinclair, Burke,
      Moore, & Farhart, 2000) used a classification system similar to that of
      Elliott et al. (1993), but changed the limiting criteria of back foot
      angle to 2900¬∞ and counter-rotation to 400¬∞. In a more recent study,
      Portus et al. (2004) rejected the back foot angle criteria, and specified
      the following to classify action types: side-on (shoulder alignment 210¬∞);
      semi-open (210¬∞‚Äì240¬∞); and mixed (pelvis-shoulder separation angle or
      counter-rotation &gt;30¬∞).</p>
      <br />

      <p>A significant disadvantage of the angle
      convention system used to classify action types is that shoulder and
      pelvic alignment angles are measured with respect to a vector running from
      the front to the rear shoulder and hip joints, respectively (Figure 1).
      Using this angle convention system, shoulder and pelvic alignment angles
      are measured in a range from 180¬∞ (perfectly side-on) to 270¬∞ (perfectly
      front-on) (Elliott, Foster, & Gray, 1986). There is no reason why these
      alignment angles cannot be defined with respect to a 0¬∞-reference line in
      the direction of the stumps at the batting end (Figure 2) as is alluded to
      in the coaching literature (Elliott, Foster, & John, 1990). This can be
      achieved if shoulder and pelvic alignments are defined by the orientation
      of vectors running from their respective rear to front joint centres.
      Similarly, all other body segment alignments can be defined with respect
      to this convention.

      defines shoulder and hip alignment from the orientation of a vector drawn
      from the left joint centre (L) to the right joint centre (R) with respect

    <p>Figure 2. The new alignment angle system defines shoulder and hip alignment from the orientation of a vector drawn from the right joint centre (RJ) to the left joint centre (LJ) with respect to the X-axis, which is aligned with the pitch. Foot alignment is defined similarly with respect to a vector running from the proximal to distal ends of the foot. The fact that fast bowlers can utilize at least four distinct bowling actions to deliver a ball, and that one of these, the mixed action, has been associated with an elevated risk of lumbar injury means that it is important to assess the distribution of bowling action types within a bowling population. Trends in bowling action type can potentially vary with the evolution of coaching paradigms, the environment, and the techniques of the most successful bowlers at an instant in time. In addition, basic coaching programmes in Australia and throughout the world train coaches to identify these basic action types (Australian Cricket Board, 1998). From a coaching perspective, it is also essential that the important kinematic determinants of bowling action type are thoroughly studied, particularly with respect to the mixed action. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to investigate the distribution and kinematic alignment characteristics of a sample of New Zealand fast bowlers. A secondary aim was to propose a coaching-oriented modification of the angle convention used to classify bowlers.</p>

        *Virtual markers were removed from the moving trials.
      </p>
    </div>

    
    <i>Participant</i>
    <p>Thirty-four fast bowlers (mean age 22.2 ¬± 0.9 years) were recruited from various competitive standards in New Zealand: premier club (n = 12), district (n = 5), first-class (n = 12), and international (n = 5). All the bowlers were free from any injury or physical dysfunction that may have affected bowling performance at the time of the data collection sessions. They provided written consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the ethics committees of The University of Auckland and The University of Waikato.</p>
    <br />

    <i>Test protocol</i>
    <p>All marker positions were subject to the general condition that they had to define a three-dimensional orthogonal joint coordinate system for their respective segments based on the methodology of Grood and Suntay (1983). The orientations of each joint coordinate system were calculated in Mathematica (Wolfram Research Ltd., v. 3.0) as z-y-x Euler angle sequences (Andrews, 1995). The bowlers initially performed a static trial with 45 retro-reflective markers (25 mm diameter) to determine the location of each joint centre with respect to a joint coordinate system (Table I). During the subsequent bowling trials, 14 markers considered potentially obstructive to performance were removed and reconstructed ‚Äúvirtually‚Äù with respect to the joint coordinate systems calculated in the static trial.</p> 
    <br />

    <p>All markers were worn on the left and right sides of the body except for the mid-PSIS (half-way between the posterior superior iliac spines), 7th cervical vertebra, suprasternal notch, and the head. Most of the marker positions were based on those listed in de Leva (1996) to define segment lengths and centres of mass (Table II). Exceptions were markers to determine the positions of the shoulder, mid-trunk, hips, and cricket ball. In particular, the calculation of the hip joint centres was based on the position of markers placed on the ASISs (anterior superior iliac spines), mid-PSIS, and greater trochanter as specified by Bell and colleagues (Bell, Pederson, & Brand, 1990).</p> 
    <br />

    <p>The calculation of the shoulder joint centres was based on the average of the positions of markers placed on the acromion, anterior deltoid and posterior deltoid in the static trial. The position of the shoulder joint centre for the bowling trials was then defined with respect to the origin of a local coordinate system on the humerus using markers placed on the posterior and lateral surfaces of the arm and the calculated location of the elbow joint centre. Although different markers were used, such a determination of the shoulder joint centre is similar to the methodology of Lloyd and colleagues (Lloyd, Alderson, & Elliott, 2000), which is used in determining bowling action legality. The cricket ball was covered with reflective tape and included as a marker.</p> 
    <br />

    <p>The trials were performed in a biomechanics laboratory, which permitted a 20-m run-up on a Mondo athletics track (Mondo America, Inc.). A crease line and movable wickets were set up according to MCC cricket laws 9.2 and 9.3 (Marylebone Cricket Club, 2000). Two Bertec force platforms (960 Hz) were embedded in the laboratory at the bowling end. An eight-camera, three-dimensional optical retro-reflective marker-based motion analysis system (Motion Analysis System Corporation Ltd.) was used to collect the movement data at 240 Hz. The capture volume was set to cover the entire delivery and release phases of the bowling action. The system was calibrated according to the manufacturer‚Äôs recommendations resulting in a residual marker position error of less than 1 mm.</p>
    <br />

    <p>The bowlers had as much time as they needed to warm up and become familiar with the laboratory set-up. They continued to bowl until they felt confident that their performance was similar to that under competitive conditions. Then, the bowlers were instructed to bowl balls within a distance of 13‚Äì18 m from the bowler‚Äôs front bowling crease as an estimate of the landing range of most deliveries bowled under match conditions. For each of the balls that landed within this range, the bowlers were required to subjectively rate the overall performance of the trial on a scale of 1 to 10.</p>

    <i><b>Kinematic data</b></i>
    <p>Coordinates of the markers were smoothed using a Butterworth fourth-order filter with cut-off frequencies (10‚Äì25 Hz) determined by a residual analysis and visual inspection of the acceleration‚Äìtime curves (Winter, 1990). These kinematic data were time-interpolated and fed as input into a three-dimensional 15-segment rigid-body model, which was designed in the Mechanical Systems Pack, a set of packages designed for the analysis of spatial rigid body mechanisms in Mathematica (Wolfram Research Ltd., v. 3.0). The general process for modelling a link chain mechanism in this software was to specify Euler angle sequences to orient each joint coordinate system with respect to the global coordinate system by concatenating the joint-link transformation matrices throughout each kinematic chain.</p>
    <br/>
    
    <p>The Mechanical Systems Pack has vector projection functions that can project the angle between two vectors on any selected plane. With respect to a right-hand bowler, the shoulder and pelvic alignment vectors were defined from the right (rear) to left (front) shoulder and rear to front hip joint centres, respectively. The foot alignment vector was defined from the marker on the calcaneus to the virtual marker on the tip of the shoe (i.e., through the long axis of the foot). These alignment vectors were projected onto the global transverse plane and angles were calculated between these vectors and the global coordinate axis running parallel to the length of the pitch (X-axis) (Figure 2). The angle convention was such that a perfectly side-on bowler has a zero-degree shoulder and pelvic alignment in the direction of the positive X-axis. Typically, such a side-on bowler has a -90 back foot alignment, running approximately parallel with the bowling crease (negative Y-axis). In contrast, a perfectly front-on bowler has a 90¬∞ alignment of the shoulders and pelvis in the direction of the positive Y-axis.</p>

    <p>Figure 3 illustrates the kinematic alignments of a bowler with respect to the new angle convention system. Vectors a, b, and c denote the shoulder, pelvis, and back foot alignments, respectively. The angle between vectors b and a is the pelvis‚Äîshoulder separation angle. The maximum clockwise rotation from the shoulder alignment vector at position I measured at back foot contact to the shoulder alignment vector at position 2 before front foot contact is the shoulder counter-rotation. Pelvic counter-rotation is measured similarly.</p>
    <br />

    <p>All data are expressed with respect to a right-hand bowler. Based on kinematic and force plate data, back foot and front foot contact were defined as the first frame when the foot contacted the ground. The following kinematic alignments were calculated:</p>

    <div style={{marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
      <p><strong>‚Ä¢ Shoulder alignment angle:</strong> angle between a line from rear to front shoulder joint centres and the global X-axis (calculated at back foot contact)</p>
      
      <p><strong>‚Ä¢ Pelvic alignment angle:</strong> angle between a line from rear to front hip joint centres and the global X-axis (calculated at back foot contact)</p>
      
      <p><strong>‚Ä¢ Pelvis‚Äîshoulder separation angle:</strong> shoulder alignment angle minus pelvic alignment angle (calculated at back foot contact and front foot contact)</p>
      
      <p><strong>‚Ä¢ Shoulder counter-rotation angle:</strong> shoulder alignment angle at back foot contact minus the minimum shoulder alignment angle during the period from back foot to front foot contact</p>
      
      <p><strong>‚Ä¢ Shoulder counter-rotation period:</strong> duration of shoulder counter-rotation in terms of normalized percentage time from back foot to front foot contact</p>
      
      <p><strong>‚Ä¢ Shoulder alignment angle at counter-rotation end:</strong> minimum shoulder alignment angle during the period from back foot to front foot contact</p>
      
      <p><strong>‚Ä¢ Pelvic counter-rotation angle:</strong> pelvic alignment angle at back foot contact minus the minimum pelvic alignment angle during the period from back foot to front foot contact</p>
      
      <p><strong>‚Ä¢ Pelvic counter-rotation period:</strong> duration of pelvic counter-rotation in terms of normalized percentage time from back foot to front foot contact</p>
      
      <p><strong>‚Ä¢ Pelvic alignment angle at counter-rotation end:</strong> minimum pelvic alignment angle during the period from back foot to front foot contact</p>
      
      <p><strong>‚Ä¢ Pelvis‚Äîshoulder opposing rotation:</strong> maximum change in pelvis‚Äîshoulder separation angle after pelvic counter-rotation (i.e. the maximum angle through which the pelvis and shoulders rotate in opposite directions)</p>
      
      <p><strong>‚Ä¢ Back foot alignment:</strong> angle between a line from the marker on the calcaneus to the marker on the head of the second metatarsal of the back foot and the global X-axis</p>
      
      <p><strong>‚Ä¢ Front foot alignment:</strong> angle between a line from the marker on the calcaneus to the marker on the head of the second metatarsal of the front foot and the global X-axis</p>
      
      <p><strong>‚Ä¢ Stride alignment:</strong> angle between a line from rear to front ankle joint centres and the global X-axis at front foot contact</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Action Classification Thresholds</h4>
    <p>In this study, the threshold values for the action classification system were adapted from Ferdinands (2004) and Portus et al. (2004). The mixed action was defined for 30¬∞ of shoulder counter-rotation or less. This was consistent with the findings of Portus et al. (2004), who found this amount of counter-rotation to be associated with serious lumbar injuries in a sample of high-performance Australian cricketers. This value was also equal to the mean of 20¬∞ and 40¬∞, which were used to define shoulder counter-rotation for the mixed action in the studies of Burnett et al. (1995) and Portus et al. (2000), respectively.</p>

    <p>Portus et al. (2000, 2004) classified side-on bowling actions with a maximum shoulder alignment angle of 30¬∞. Since the coaching literature specifies that the side-on technique requires the shoulders to be aligned towards the batter (Australian Cricket Board, 2008; National Cricket Academy, 2009; Tyson, 1976), this value was considered too high. Hence, the maximum shoulder alignment angle for a side-on action was reduced to 25¬∞ (Ferdinands, 2004). Consistent with the approach of Portus et al. (2004), this value was doubled to obtain the minimum shoulder alignment for the front-on bowler (50¬∞). This resulted in a shoulder alignment range of 25‚Äî50¬∞ for the semi-open action.</p>
     <br />

    <p>The resulting threshold criteria define what is referred to in this study as the basic action classification system:</p>

    <div style={{marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
      <p><strong>‚Ä¢ Side-on:</strong> shoulder alignment &lt;25¬∞ AND shoulder counter-rotation &lt;30¬∞</p>
      <p><strong>‚Ä¢ Semi-open:</strong> 25¬∞ ‚â§ shoulder alignment &lt;50¬∞ AND shoulder counter-rotation &lt;30¬∞</p>
      <p><strong>‚Ä¢ Front-on:</strong> shoulder alignment ‚â•50¬∞ AND shoulder counter-rotation &lt;30¬∞</p>
      <p><strong>‚Ä¢ Mixed:</strong> pelvis‚Äîshoulder separation angle &gt;30¬∞ OR shoulder counter-rotation &gt;30¬∞</p>
    </div>

    <h4>Statistical Analysis</h4>
    <p>For each participant, the bowling trial with the highest ball speed and a subjective ranking of seven or above was chosen for analysis. The data were initially analysed using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) via the generalized linear model (GLM) to test for the main effects of action classification and level of competition and their interaction on selected kinematic alignment variables. The standard tests for normality, sphericity, and homogeneity of variance found that these assumptions were valid (Munro, 2005). Levene's test for the assumption of homogeneity for a significance level of 0.05 was satisfied by all kinematic alignment variables except back foot alignment angle at back foot contact, shoulder alignment at front foot contact, and stride alignment.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Next, all data were analysed with one-way ANOVA with level of competition as a covariate. If these results were similar to the two-way ANOVA, then the one-way ANOVA with Bonferroni post-hoc tests (Œ± = 0.05) was used for statistical analysis.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Partial correlation analysis was performed for all kinematic variables with level of competition specified as the control variable. The strengths of the correlation coefficients were defined as small (0.1 - 0.29), moderate (0.3-0.49), and strong (&gt;0.49) (Cohen, 1988). In terms of r¬≤-values, these descriptors of correlation strength correspond to small (0.01-0.08), moderate (0.09‚Äî0.24), and strong (&gt;0.24). Linear stepwise regression analysis was used to find the dependence of shoulder counter-rotation on potential explanatory variables, such as pelvis‚Äîshoulder separation angle and shoulder alignment angle. All statistical data analyses were performed in SPSS v. 16.0 Release 2.0 (SPSS, Inc.).</p>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    
    <h4>Basic Action Distribution</h4>
    <p>Based on the action classification system used in this study, 64.7% (n = 22) of bowlers had a mixed bowling action (Table III). Most of these bowlers were classified as mixed based on the amount of shoulder counter-rotation during the delivery stride. In fact, only two bowlers were classified as mixed based solely on the pelvis‚Äîshoulder separation at back foot contact. Many mixed-action bowlers had high shoulder counter-rotation: 40.9% in excess of 30¬∞, 22.7% in excess of 40¬∞, 18.2% in excess of 50¬∞, and 4.5% in excess of 60¬∞.</p>

    <h4>Kinematic Correlations</h4>
    <p>Partial correlation analysis of the major kinematic variables is shown in Table VI. In order of descending strength, the strongest correlations with shoulder counter-rotation were shoulder alignment, pelvis-shoulder separation angle at back foot contact, pelvic alignment at back foot contact, and stride alignment at front foot contact. Similarly, in order of descending strength, the strongest significant predictors of front foot alignment at front foot contact were stride alignment, shoulder alignment at front foot contact, and shoulder alignment at back foot contact. Back foot alignment at back foot contact was strongly correlated with pelvic alignment at back foot contact. Pelvis-shoulder opposing rotation was only weakly correlated with pelvis-shoulder separation angle at back foot contact. There was only one weak significant correlation with ball speed: pelvis-shoulder separation at front foot contact. A pure linear regression between shoulder alignment angle at back foot contact and shoulder counter-rotation had an r¬≤-value of 0.622 (Figure 4), which was very similar to the r¬≤-value of 0.617 obtained through the partial correlation analysis. This indicates that the control variable of competition level had a minimal effect on the correlation coefficients.</p>

    <p>Data for stride and foot alignment at front foot contact, and pelvic counter-rotation period are not shown in Table VI. There was a strong correlation between stride alignment and foot alignment (r¬≤ = 0.48, P = 0.001). Pelvic counter-rotation and pelvic counter-rotation period were moderately correlated with shoulder counter-rotation (r¬≤ = 0.13, P = 0.086 and r¬≤ = 0.09, P = 0.038, respectively).</p>

    <h4>Kinematic Alignment Characteristics Between Groups</h4>
    <p>The multivariate analysis indicated that the only main effect of competition level was on ball release speed. The club group had significantly lower ball release speed than the first-class (P = 0.003) and international groups (P = 0.020). In addition, there was no significant interaction effect between action type and competition group across all kinematic variables. Hence, the kinematic data were analysed using a one-way ANOVA to test for significant differences between the groups with level of competition as a covariate.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Table V shows which groups were significantly different from each other with respect to fundamental mean alignment characteristics according to the one-way ANOVA. As there was only one front-on bowler, post-hoc testing was not applicable to these data. There were significant differences between the shoulder alignment at back foot contact (F = 24.1, P &lt; 0.001), pelvis‚Äîshoulder separation angle at back foot contact (F = 6.0, P = 0.007), and shoulder counter-rotation (F = 18.1, P &lt; 0.001) between the bowling action groups.</p>

    <p>All the basic action types were significantly different from each other in terms of shoulder alignment at back foot contact (P &lt; 0.05). Most significantly, the mixed action group was more open (22.4 ¬± 5.2¬∞) and (39.2 ¬± 5.6¬∞) than both the semi-open (P = 0.001) and the side-on groups (P &lt; 0.001), respectively. The mixed action group had more pelvis‚Äîshoulder separation at back foot contact (19.8 ¬± 5.9¬∞) than the semi-open group (P = 0.018), but not the side-on group. The mixed action group also had significantly more shoulder counter-rotation (17.7 ¬± 4.2¬∞) and (24.7 ¬± 4.6¬∞) than both the semi-open and front-on groups (P &lt; 0.001), respectively.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Data for the stride alignment and front foot alignment at front foot contact are not shown in Table V. The mixed-action group tended to have a slightly more open stride alignment than the side-on group (5.1 ¬± 2.1, P = 0.065). There was no significant difference in front foot alignment between the groups, but 50% of the bowlers had an open front foot alignment. Half of these bowlers had front foot alignments that were open in excess of 10¬∞.</p>

    <h3>Discussion</h3>
    
    <p>The main aim of this study was to assess the distribution and kinematic properties of bowling action types in a sample of New Zealand bowlers using a more practical angle convention. In particular, we were interested in the kinematic factors associated with the mixed-action technique because this action is not recommended from either a performance or injury risk perspective (Australian Cricket Board, 1998; Elliott, 2000; Portus et al., 2000, 2004, 2007).</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Threshold Criteria and Angle Convention System</h4>
    <p>The basic action classification system categorizes the four basic types of action: side-on, semi-open, front-on, and mixed. The data support the use of this and previous classification systems that (i) specify independent threshold values for shoulder counter-rotation and pelvic-shoulder separation angle to define the mixed action, and (ii) do not include back foot alignment.</p>
    <br />

    <p>If a classification system specifies both counter-rotation and pelvis‚Äîshoulder separation angle to be greater than a certain threshold to define a mixed action, then front-on bowlers could have high shoulder counter-rotation. Using a classification such as that developed by Burnett et al. (1995), which sets threshold criteria for a mixed action at 20¬∞ for both of these variables, we found that 63.6% of the front-on bowlers had counter-rotation in excess of 30¬∞. High values of counter-rotation should not be used in any classification of the front-on action, which is an effective and relatively safe method of bowling (Australian Cricket Board, 1998; Elliott, 2000; Portus et al., 2004).</p>
    <br />

    <p>Although back foot alignment was moderately associated with pelvic alignment angle (r¬≤ = 0.579), there was no significant association between back foot alignment and shoulder alignment. Bowlers were able to achieve a side-on shoulder alignment and open back foot alignment, which does not fit into any category of classification systems that specify a back foot alignment. This resulted in 11.8% of unclassified bowlers according to the classification system of Portus et al. (2000) (Table III), which included back foot alignment.</p>
    <br />

    <p>In this study, the angle convention was more practical than the previous convention for bowling action classification. Similarly, a positive angle means an open alignment and a negative angle means a closed alignment. There are no major flips in the data if an alignment variable changes from open to closed or vice versa. Data equivalence for left-hand bowlers is simply achieved by multiplying by minus one.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Action Type Distribution</h4>
    <p>We found that the mixed action was the most common bowling technique, followed by the semi-open and side-on actions (Table III). As the sample was relatively large for bowlers and was representative of bowlers from a range of levels of competition, these results suggest that fast bowlers in New Zealand have generally moved away from the side-on action. Even with respect to the alternative classifications of action type, the percentage of side-on bowlers in the sample was still less than 20%. In addition, shoulder alignment data suggest that even those bowlers classified as side-on did not adhere to the classical side-on form: shoulders aligned wicket to wicket and head positioned outside the front arm to view the target area (Marylebone Cricket Club, 1976). Instead, the shoulders were still relatively open (21.7 ¬± 1.8¬∞) to the line of the stumps, and some previous classification systems such as that of Burnett et al. (1995) (i.e. shoulder alignment less than 20¬∞ at back foot contact) would have classified three of the five side-on bowlers in this study as front-on.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Importantly, studies on Australian and English bowlers show a similar distribution of bowling action types. Portus et al. (2004) analysed the three-dimensional kinematic data of 42 adult high-performance Australian bowlers. They found an even higher proportion of mixed-action bowlers (72.8%). Of the remaining bowlers, only two were side-on (4.8%), six semi-open (14.3%), and three front-on (7.1%). Ranson and colleagues (Ranson, Burnett, King, Patel, & O'Sullivan, 2008) analysed 50 English county professional bowlers and found a similar distribution of bowlers: 39 mixed (78%), eight semi-open (16%), and three side-on (6%). Like the New Zealand sample, the Australian and English bowlers have moved away from the use of the traditional side-on bowling technique and have largely adopted the mixed-action, which generally requires an open shoulder alignment at back foot contact (Portus et al., 2004). This represents a significant departure from the traditional coaching literature, which emphasizes a side-on action. It is not possible to compare quantitatively the action distributions of bowlers in past eras. However, an observation of past cricket video footage (Arlott, 1994) and even older action photography of bowlers in the early 1900s (Beldam & Fry, 1906) reveals that the side-on action was predominant throughout most of cricket history.</p>
    <br />
    <p>The move away from the side-on bowling technique would not be problematic if this was compensated by a significant increase in semi-open and front-on techniques. However, in this study there was only one more bowler in the semi-open group than in the side-on group, and there was only one front-on bowler in the sample. Instead, there was a predominance of mixed bowlers. Of the 22 mixed-action bowlers, 20 were classified as mixed based on the amount of shoulder counter-rotation. In fact, the majority of the mixed-action bowlers (59.1%) had shoulder counter-rotations in excess of 40¬∞, with a further 22.7% of these having shoulder counter-rotations in excess of 50¬∞. There were even 4.5% with shoulder counter-rotations in excess of 60¬∞. This is problematic, as there are no known benefits of high levels of shoulder counter-rotation. Portus et al. (2000) found that shoulder counter-rotation was associated with decreased accuracy, particularly in the latter overs of an 8-over spell. In addition, although not a causal mechanism of lumbar injury (Ranson et al., 2008), many studies have shown that shoulder counter-rotation is associated with an increased risk of lumbar injury (Burnett et al., 1996; Elliott & Khangure, 2002; Portus et al., 2004, 2007). However, this association may be restricted to populations of younger bowlers (Elliott et al., 1993; Portus et al., 2007; Ranson et al., 2008).</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Kinematic Alignment Characteristics</h4>
    <p>As shoulder counter-rotation is not a recommended characteristic of bowling, it is important for researchers to determine any major kinematic factors associated with shoulder counter-rotation. One such kinematic factor was shoulder alignment. The mean shoulder alignment at back foot contact for the mixed-action group was 60.4 ¬± 12.6¬∞ (Table V), which was over 10¬∞ in excess of the shoulder alignment required to classify a front-on bowler. Mixed-action bowlers tended to use a front-on shoulder alignment. Furthermore, post-hoc multi-comparison tests show that the mixed-action group had a significantly more open shoulder alignment (22.4 ¬± 5.2¬∞ and 39.2 ¬± 5.6¬∞) than both the semi-open and side-on groups, respectively. There was also a strong correlation between shoulder alignment and counter-rotation (r¬≤ = 0.622, P = 0.007), effectively showing that shoulder alignment angle is a strong predictor of shoulder counter-rotation. Bowlers with an open or front-on shoulder alignment may need to counter-rotate the shoulders to a more side-on alignment at front foot contact to pre-stretch the anterior shoulder musculature when the bowling arm is horizontal behind the body prior to the acceleration phase of the bowling arm. Hence, there is some evidence to support the recommendation for bowlers to develop the semi-open technique rather than adopt the more open shoulder alignment of the front-on technique wherever possible to prevent the possibility of degeneration to a mixed-action technique, which becomes even more likely when fatigued (Portus et al., 2000).</p>
    <br />

    <p>Previous researchers have proposed that the pelvis‚Äîshoulder separation angle is a predictor of shoulder counter-rotation (Elliott et al., 1990). In theory, a large pelvis‚Äîshoulder separation angle at back foot contact may establish a stretch‚Äîshortening cycle in the trunk rotators that would promote shoulder counter-rotation during the delivery stride. This mechanism cannot be confirmed in this study, but we found that pelvis‚Äîshoulder separation angle accounted for 20.2% of the variation in shoulder counter-rotation. However, even if the pelvis and shoulders were relatively aligned at back foot contact, this is not sufficient to prevent a bowler from counter-rotating the shoulders. There is no anatomical constraint in place during the delivery stride to prevent the shoulders from rotating in either direction ‚Äî that is, either rotating to the left (anticlockwise) away from the batsman, or counter-rotating towards the right (clockwise). Hence, in addition to reducing pelvis‚Äîshoulder separation angle, bowlers also need to establish independent movement patterns if they intend to prevent excessive shoulder counter-rotation.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Although not significantly associated with shoulder counter-rotation, back foot alignment was moderately associated with pelvic alignment and pelvis‚Äîshoulder separation angle at back foot contact, both of which were moderately associated with shoulder counter-rotation. Hence, the opening of the back foot in front-on actions may assist to reduce the pelvis‚Äîshoulder separation angle, and indirectly reduce the amount of subsequent shoulder counter-rotation.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Pelvis‚Äîshoulder opposing rotation was not significantly correlated with shoulder counter-rotation, but moderately correlated with pelvis‚Äîshoulder separation angle (r¬≤ = 0.129). This supports the hypothesis that a pelvis‚Äîshoulder separation angle sets up a stretch‚Äîshortening cycle that tends to rotate the pelvis and shoulders in opposite directions in accordance with Newton's action‚Äîreaction principle. When such opposing rotation becomes high, bowling accuracy may be compromised, since the relative motion between the pelvis and shoulders needs to be compensated for rapidly. This may also cause problems with pelvic and shoulder alignment at front foot contact and ball release.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Pelvic counter-rotation and pelvic counter-rotation period were moderately correlated with shoulder counter-rotation although the former was only significant at P &lt; 0.09. If pelvic counter-rotation has a lower rate than shoulder counter-rotation, then there is a reduction in the pelvis‚Äîshoulder separation angle as the delivery stride progresses towards front foot contact. However, if pelvic counter-rotation occurs at a higher rate than shoulder counter-rotation, then there is an increase in the pelvis‚Äîshoulder separation angle as the delivery stride progresses. This would tend to increase the pre-stretch of the trunk rotators, producing a powerful counter-rotation of the shoulders, since the pelvis is closing more rapidly than the shoulders. The period of pelvic counter-rotation may also affect the alignment of the shoulders and pelvis at front foot contact. More research is needed to establish the relationship between pelvic counter-rotation and shoulder counter-rotation.</p>
    <br />

    <p>There was no association between shoulder counter-rotation and ball speed. The only kinematic variable that had a significant but weak association with ball speed was the pelvis‚Äîshoulder separation angle at front foot contact (r¬≤ = 0.130). At this point, the shoulders and pelvis are rotating rapidly causing the bowling arm to lag behind the body in a horizontal position setting up a strong stretch‚Äîshortening cycle in the anterior shoulder musculature, which will assist in the angular acceleration of the bowling arm up to ball release.</p>
    <br />
    <p>Although not specified in the action classification system, coaches consider stride alignment and front foot alignment as important elements of bowling technique (Bartlett et al., 1996; National Cricket Academy, 2009). A slightly more open stride alignment was symptomatic of the mixed-action group, and there was a strong correlation between front foot alignment and stride alignment. In accordance with the action-reaction principle, the closing of the shoulders during counter-rotation may cause the hips and front leg to open causing a more open stride alignment and front foot alignment. There was no significant difference in front foot alignment between the groups, but 25% of bowlers had the front foot open in excess of 10¬∞, which is not recommended for any type of action.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Limitations</h4>
    <p>This study used a different marker positioning protocol than that formally required by the International Cricket Council (2010) to determine bowling legality. Characteristic of cluster marker systems, there may be some relative motion between markers placed on the posterior and lateral surfaces of the upper arm, and this could lead to inaccuracies in the calculation of shoulder joint centres. In addition, the specification of shoulder alignment thresholds that classify action type may also differ between shoulder marker protocols. To estimate the accuracy of each of these marker protocols, researchers need to perform a comparative study with imaging data of the humeral head.</p>
    <br />

    <p>It is also technically more accurate to measure counter-rotation in terms of thoracic rotation rather than shoulder rotation. The rotation of the shoulders may include a component of scapula movement. However, Elliott and colleagues (Elliott, Wallis, Sakurai, Lloyd, & Besier, 2002) found that both two- and three-dimensional transverse plane projections of shoulder alignment are reasonable estimates of thoracic alignment at back foot impact and front foot impact. In addition, cricket coaches have more access to two-dimensional video motion analysis systems, which are more effective in measuring shoulder rotation. Hence, in the basic classification system, shoulder counter-rotation was defined in terms of a change in shoulder alignment angle. In addition, the allowable run-up length was only 20 m, which may have been shorter than the competitive run-up of bowlers in the faster bowling groups.</p>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>In this study, the actions of a sample of New Zealand bowlers were classified according to a basic action classification system using a new angle convention. Consistent with previous studies in Australia and England, most bowlers used the mixed-action technique. The traditional side-on action is now relatively rare. As the mixed-action technique may compromise performance and increase the risk of lumbar injury, a fundamental coaching practice throughout the world is to identify a bowler's action type. The two major predictors of the mixed-action technique are open shoulder alignment and pelvis‚Äîshoulder separation angle. Coaches may consider closing the shoulder alignment and reducing the pelvis‚Äîshoulder separation angle to limit the amount of shoulder counter-rotation. An increase in the proportion of side-on and semi-open bowlers may result in positive performance characteristics and reduce the risk of lumbar injury. In addition, the new angle convention in this study simplifies the classification of bowlers according to action type.</p>
