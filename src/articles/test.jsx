    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p className="abstract">The classification of bowling actions in cricket is particularly important from an injury perspective. Research has consistently shown that bowlers with a mixed-action technique have an elevated risk of sustaining serious lumbar injury. In this study, 34 New Zealand bowlers (mean age 22.2 ±0.9 years) of premier competition standard and above were assessed using a three-dimensional motion analysis system (240 Hz). Data were analysed using three previous classification systems before classifying bowlers into the side-on, semi-open, front-on, and mixed-action types based on a modified set of angle threshold criteria and a more intuitive angle convention system. The majority of bowlers in the sample (64.7%) used the mixed action with high levels of shoulder counter-rotation. The strongest predictors of shoulder counter-rotation were shoulder alignment angle and pelvic–shoulder separation angle. The current results suggest that a large proportion of fast bowlers may be at a higher risk of lumbar injury from the use of the mixed-action technique. We believe it may be advisable to recommend the semi-open action as an alternative to the front-on action. In addition, the adopted angle convention is more practical than the previous convention for bowling action classification.</p>

    <p>Classification of action types in cricket bowling is important, particularly from a coaching perspective. Bowlers can use a side-on, semi-open, front-on or mixed action (National Cricket Academy, 2009; Portus, Mason, Elliott, Pfitzner, & Done, 2004). Each of these actions has distinctly different kinematic properties, such as shoulder alignment, pelvic alignment, and run-up speed (Bartlett, Stockill, Elliott, & Burnett, 1996). The general consensus is that the side-on, semi-open, and front-on actions are relatively safe and effective bowling techniques. The mixed action is associated with an elevated risk of lumbar injury (Burnett et al., 1996; Hardcastle, 1991; Portus et al., 2004), although this association may be restricted to younger bowling populations (Elliott, Davis, Khangure, & Hardcastle, 1993; Portus, Galloway, Elliott, & Lloyd, 2007; Stretch, 1995). The mixed-action technique has been classified in terms of shoulder counter-rotation (i.e. the maximum amount of rotation of the rear shoulder away from the batter in the transverse plane during the delivery stride) and pelvis–shoulder separation angle (Burnett, Elliott, & Marshall, 1995; Elliott et al., 1993; Portus et al., 2004).</p>
    <h3>Methods</h3>
    <h4>Participants</h4>
    <p>Thirty-four fast bowlers (mean age 22.2 ±0.9 years) were recruited from various competitive standards in New Zealand: premier club (n = 12), district (n =5), first-class (n = 12), and international (n =5). All the bowlers were free from any injury or physical dysfunction that may have affected bowling performance at the time of the data collection sessions. They provided written consent to participate in the study, which was approved by the ethics committees of The University of Auckland and The University of Waikato.</p>
    <h4>Test protocol</h4>
    <p>All marker positions were subject to the general condition that they had to define a three-dimensional orthogonal joint coordinate system for their respective segments based on the methodology of Grood and Suntay (1983). The bowlers initially performed a static trial with 45 retro-reflective markers (25 mm diameter) to determine the location of each joint centre with respect to a joint coordinate system. During the subsequent bowling trials, 14 markers considered potentially obstructive to performance were removed and reconstructed "virtually" with respect to the joint coordinate systems calculated in the static trial.</p>
    <h4>Kinematic data</h4>
    <p>Coordinates of the markers were smoothed using a Butterworth fourth-order filter with cut-off frequencies (10—25 Hz) determined by a residual analysis and visual inspection of the acceleration–time curves (Winter, 1990). These kinematic data were time-interpolated and fed as input into a three-dimensional 15-segment rigid-body model.</p>
    <h4>Action classification thresholds</h4>
    <p>In this study, the threshold values for the action classification system were adapted from Ferdinands (2004) and Portus et al. (2004). The mixed action was defined for 30° of shoulder counter-rotation or more. The resulting threshold criteria define what is referred to in this study as the basic action classification system shown below:
    <br/>• side-on: shoulder alignment {'<25°'} AND shoulder counter-rotation {'<30°'}
    <br/>• semi-open: 25° {'≤'} shoulder alignment {'<50°'} AND shoulder counter-rotation {'<30°'}
    <br/>• front-on: shoulder alignment {'≥50°'} AND shoulder counter-rotation {'<30°'}
    <br/>• mixed: pelvis–shoulder separation angle {'> 30°'} OR shoulder counter-rotation {'>30°'}
    </p>
    <h4>Statistical analysis</h4>
    <p>For each participant, the bowling trial with the highest ball speed and a subjective ranking of seven or above was chosen for analysis. The data were initially analysed using a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) via the generalized linear model (GLM) to test for the main effects of action classification and level of competition and their interaction on selected kinematic alignment variables. Partial correlation analysis was performed for all kinematic variables with level of competition specified as the control variable. Linear stepwise regression analysis was used to find the dependence of shoulder counter-rotation on potential explanatory variables.</p>
    <h3>Results</h3>
    <h4>Basic action distribution</h4>
    <p>Based on the action classification system used in this study, 64.7% (n =22) of bowlers had a mixed bowling action. Most of these bowlers were classified as mixed based on the amount of shoulder counter-rotation during the delivery stride. In fact, only two bowlers were classified as mixed based solely on the pelvis–shoulder separation at back foot contact. Many mixed-action bowlers had high shoulder counter-rotation: 40.9% in excess of 30°, 22.7% in excess of 40°, 18.2% in excess of 50°, and 4.5% in excess of 60°.</p>

    <h4>Kinematic correlations</h4>
    <p>In order of descending strength, the strongest correlations with shoulder counter-rotation were shoulder alignment, pelvis–shoulder separation angle at back foot contact, pelvic alignment at back foot contact, and stride alignment at front foot contact. A pure linear regression between shoulder alignment angle at back foot contact and shoulder counter-rotation had an r²-value of 0.622.</p>
    <h4>Kinematic alignment characteristics between groups</h4>
    <p>There were significant differences between the shoulder alignment at back foot contact (F=24.1, P{'<0.001'}), pelvis–shoulder separation angle at back foot contact (F = 6.0, P = 0.007), and shoulder counter-rotation (F=18.1, P{'<0.001'}) between the bowling action groups. The mixed action group was more open and had significantly more shoulder counter-rotation than both the semi-open and front-on groups.</p>
    <h3>Discussion</h3>
    <p>The main aim of this study was to assess the distribution and kinematic properties of bowling actions types in a sample of New Zealand bowlers using a more practical angle convention. We found that the mixed action was the most common bowling technique, followed by the semi-open and side-on actions. As the sample was relatively large for bowlers and was representative of bowlers from a range of levels of competition, these results suggest that fast bowlers in New Zealand have generally moved away from the side-on action.</p>
    <p>The two major predictors of the mixed-action technique are open shoulder alignment and pelvis–shoulder separation angle. Bowlers with an open or front-on shoulder alignment may need to counter-rotate the shoulders to a more side-on alignment at front foot contact to pre-stretch the anterior shoulder musculature when the bowling arm is horizontal behind the body prior to the acceleration phase of the bowling arm.</p>
    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>In this study, the actions of a sample of New Zealand bowlers were classified according to a basic action classification system convention using a new angle convention. Consistent with previous studies in Australia and England, most bowlers used the mixed-action technique. The traditional side-on action is now relatively rare. As the mixed-action technique may compromise performance and increase the risk of lumbar injury, a fundamental coaching practice throughout the world is to identify a bowler's action type. Coaches may consider closing the shoulder alignment and reducing the pelvis–separation angle to limit the amount of shoulder counter-rotation. In addition, the new angle convention in this study simplifies the classification of bowlers according to action type.</p>
