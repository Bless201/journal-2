    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p className="abstract">
      This study explored the influence of demographic characteristics on gender ideology, self-concept and participation in adult learning programmes among Benin women. While several studies have explored factors influencing participation in adult education, there remains a limited research as to how specific demographic variables intersect with gender ideology and self-concept and how it influences women's participation in adult learning programmes. To guide this study, seven research questions were raised and hypotheses formulated. The study adopted the descriptive survey research design. The population of the study consisted of 406 women of the Benin ethnic group, who are participants in adult learning programmes and also formed the sample for the study because of its manageable size. A questionnaire was used for data collection. Data gathered were analysed using Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient (r) and Fishers Z. Findings of the study showed that there was a significant and positive relationship among gender ideology, self-concept and participation in adult learning programmes among Benin women. Based on the findings, it was recommended among others that, learning initiatives for adults should be designed with sensitivity to the diverse demographic characteristics of women in specific geographical regions.

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      In contemporary society, education is increasingly recognized as a vital tool for personal empowerment and societal development. Among adult populations, particularly women, participation in learning programmes serves not only as a pathway to skill acquisition and self-improvement but also as a catalyst for challenging and reshaping traditional gender ideologies. In the context of Benin women in Edo State, Nigeria, various demographic variables such as age, marital status, educational background, economic status, and cultural orientation play significant roles in shaping their gender beliefs, self-concept, and decisions to engage in adult education programmes. Understanding the influence of these factors is critical for developing inclusive educational policies and interventions that promote gender equality and women's empowerment. This study, therefore, seeks to explore how demographic characteristics impact gender ideology, self-concept, and participation in adult learning among Benin women, shedding light on the complex interplay between societal structures and individual agency in the pursuit of lifelong learning.

    <br />

    <h4>Concept of Gender Ideology</h4>
    <p>
      In different cultures across the world, there are expectations regarding the appropriate roles, rights and responsibilities of men and women respectively, and this has been referred to by scholars as Gender Ideology. The study of gender ideologies is concerned with describing and explaining cross-cultural similarities and differences in human views of women, men, and alternative gender identities (Ridgeway, 2020). This concept of gender ideology, that is, culturally constructed nature of gender has rarely been discussed in relation to possible influence on adult learner self-concept in general and on women folks in particular. Depending on the culture of a woman’s immediate family, ethnic community and geographical region women are conceptualized as inferior to men to justify and sustain social and cultural systems dominated by men. Women’s self-concept and identity often begin with an individual first confronting her own hegemonic beliefs about what is appropriate and/or not appropriate for a woman in a traditional gender-stratified society including articulation of power relations, especially the way men and women relate in society. The socialization process in a patriarchal society is likely to shape the self-concept of men and women differently, and as such, when a woman decides to engage in a learning programme, her ability to thrive in the learning situation is dependent on whether or not she possesses the expected self-concept required to thrive (Moorhouse & Kohnke, 2023).
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Self concept and Adulthood</h4>
    <p>
      The psychological study of self concept and its development has a long tradition and has received varying amounts of attention. Historically, the study of self concept has been approached from a number of different theoretical perspectives. According to a theory known as social identity theory, self-concept is composed of two key parts: personal identity and social identity. Our personal identity includes such things as personality traits and other characteristics that make each person unique. Social identity includes the groups we belong to including our community, ethnicity, race, culture, religion, college, and other groups. This social identity theory is pivotal to this study to understand the self concept of adult learners.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Self-concept is the conscious manifestation of one’s own identity. The concept of self is mostly referred to as the totality of a complete, organized and dynamic system of learned beliefs, attitudes and opinions that each person holds to be true about his personal existence (Stets & Serpe, 2022). Every person has some conception or ideas of his/her own self. Self-concept is not innate; it is developed by the individual through interaction with the environment. Adults with a positive self-concept are intrinsically motivated to remedy or continue their school having missed their first chance or dropped out upon the realization that they can make it after all. This shows that self-concept is dynamic and can be modified or changed. Furthermore, self-concept is developed through the process of taking action and then reflecting on what the person does and what people say about what he or she does. The self-concept of an individual adult moves from that of being a dependent person toward being an independent, self-directed person (Cunningham & Wigfield, 2021).
    </p>
    <br />


    <h4>Participation in Adult Education</h4>
    <p>
      Historically, participation in adult education is largely a voluntary activity because it is expected that adults know what they want. Without volunteer learners, adult education would be a much smaller enterprise. Providers of adult education do not only need to know who is participating and why they are participating but what conditions are likely to promote greater participation. Knowing why some adults participate in adult education does not tell why many do not. Reasons adults do not participate have been clustered by several researchers into the types of barrier. Of interest to this study is the psychosocial obstacle such as beliefs, values, attitudes and perceptions about education or about oneself as a learner, that is, the learners’ self-concept is said to be at the heart of non participation (Bhana & Moosa, 2022). The way a woman feels about herself, her self-esteem and self confidence, and the way she expresses herself are significant elements in her decision about whether or not to participate in an adult education programme. They recommended that more research be conducted on specific structural factors such as race and gender that enhance or impede participation. Participation is vital and of paramount importance in any adult and non-formal programme. For any successful programme, full participation of the target group is important (Onyishi, 2014).
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Women Participation in Learning Programmes</h4>
    <p>
      According to Tisdell (2021), women make up the majority of adult learners still; consideration for women has been consistently left out of the planning process in adult education. This is evidenced through the “deficit model” approach often used by educators which assumes that learners must “catch up” with the rest of society or with their peers, and potentially fail to consider the diverse knowledge and experience that learners bring to the learning environment. The result of this failure is that too often, it sabotages what might otherwise be a useful learning experience for women who feel devalued and defeated. Adult learning theory has also failed in the depth of its consideration of gender differences in adult learners. Studies on women have tended to observe only variations in the linear “adult life stages’. Some researchers have proposed entirely different ways of looking at the development of women. Okech & Ulimwengu (2023) urged that women’s social connectedness and multiplicity of roles, as well as a reconsideration of the presumed linear nature of adult development be examined. They also opined that no theory can explain the full breath of women’s experiences.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Ethnography of the Benin People</h4>
    <p>
      The name “Benin” is both a geo-political and demographic ethnic identity and expression. It refers to the land and the people indigenous to the land hence, the word Benin here mean the indigenous people of the modern south senatorial district of Edo State, South-South Nigeria. The total area of Benin covering its present seven local government areas (Oredo, Orionhnwon, Ovia South west, Ovia North East, Egor, Ikpoba-okha and Uhunwonde) is about 10,360 square kilometres (Eghafona and Osunde, 2017). The name Edo, on other hand was said to have been the name of a slave, who saved Oba Ewuare (1440-1473) from being killed. To immortalize Edo’s name for the services he rendered, Oba Ewuare changed the name of the land to Edo. Today, the names Edo and Benin have been used interchangeably, Edo is better used in speaking vernacular while Benin in speaking English. In this study therefore, the people and language will be referred to as Benin. Benin City is the ancestral home of the Benin people who trace their genealogy to a common ancestor. Presently, there are different ethnic groups living in Benin City, but these people are different from the Benin indigenes since they do not share a common ancestral history traced to the palace of the Benin Kingdom ruled by a king known as the Oba. (Egharevba cited in Eghafona and Osunde 2017)
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Consequently, in a traditional gender-stratified society, there are expectations regarding the appropriate roles, rights and responsibilities of men and women respectively, including articulation of power relations, especially the way men and women relate in society. Examples of what is appropriate and/or not appropriate for a woman include: women and men don’t use the same bathing buckets, women do not take decisions in the home. It is exclusively for the men, funeral rites / mourning expectations differ for Widows and widowers, Women are considered unclean during their monthly periods, the role and duty of women is to taking care of the children and the household, parents give high value to son’s education because they are potential providers and perpetrators of family names, girls should be given priority on training in domestic chores rather than to their education, Parents give less priority on daughters’ education because they will go away another house after marriage, the responsibility of giving out daughters in marriage is exclusively for men as well as, women are ‘seen not heard’ to mention a few.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Possible Demographic Factors Influencing Gender Ideology, Self Concept and Women Participation in Adult Education</h4>
    <p>
      This study however also further considers the influence of demographic factors such as age, marital status, educational background, family background, employment status, and religious affiliations. According to Aminchi (2015), age is a vital factor in learning and with older learners, it is important to note that there are phases in adulthood which could be a determinant for adults at different stages and possibly influence self concept and gender idealogy or stereotypes. Learners who are married especially women are affected by domestic responsibilities as well as social responsibility within the community which could also be a factor Formatted: factor influencing their participation in learning. Considering the previous educational experiences of adults, it could be that adult’s past experiences of education are key determinants in their self-belief and identity as a capable learner, and of their likelihood of actively contemplating learning. Perception of education as a tool for empowerment is derived from positive past educational experiences, or participants feeling that they did not reach their potential during previous learning endeavours.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      As regards family background, research fills the gap in which gender ideology and divorce are connected when the effect of gender ideology on parents’ marital status were considered it is of interest to find out if learners self concept, gender ideology and participation in adult learning programmes spans from family background. A larger number of longitudinal studies, however, found that women’s gender egalitarianism is positively related to their subsequent participation in the labour market. The possibility that women’s employment status, are likely to shape leaners self identity and orientations toward gendered roles and ultimately participation in learning programmes is also of interest. About the influence of religion on the current and future of roles of women in society, it is a significant means through which women roles and statuses in the society are perpetuated. The study seeks find out its relationship with women’s participation in adult learning and if it varies from one religion to the other.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Statement of the Problem</h4>
    <p>
      The importance of adult learning programmes as a tool for personal development, empowerment and societal contribution has gained significant attention. However, despite widespread efforts to promote adult education, it has been observed that participation rates among women, particularly in traditional societies like the Benin ethnic group of Edo State, Nigeria, remain relatively low even when women make up the majority of adult learners. While several studies have explored factors affecting adult education participation, there remains a limited understanding of how specific demographic variables intersect with gender ideology and self-concept to influence women's participation in adult learning programmes in particular. Without this understanding, interventions may fail to address the root causes of low participation among women, thereby perpetuating educational inequalities and limiting opportunities for women's empowerment in the region. Given the centrality of education to personal and community development, this study seeks to investigate the influence of demographic variables on gender ideology, self-concept, and participation in adult learning programmes among Benin women in Edo State. Particularly given the varying intensity of patriarchal structures across different social groups in Nigeria, it is a critical area where further research is urgently needed.

    </ol>

    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>
      The study adopted the descriptive survey research design. The population of the study consisted of 406 women of Benin origin who are participants in adult learning programmes in both government and private centres in Edo South Senatorial District. The entire population was used for the study because of its manageable size. Therefore, there was no sampling, Hence a census. A self constructed questionnaire was used as research instrument for data collection. The instrument for data collection was validated by three experts in all. Two experts in the department of Adult and Continuing Education and one expert in Measurement and Evaluation from the Faculty of Education, University of Benin, Benin City. Corrections on the appropriateness of language and expression were made and incorporated into the final draft of the instrument. The scoring pattern of the response scale was a four-point modified likert scale of Strongly Agree (SA), Agree (A), Disagree (D) and Strongly Disagree (SD) and scored 4, 3, 2, and 1 respectively. To establish the reliability of the instrument, it was pilot tested with twenty (20) women from the adult learning centres who also formed part of the study sample. Data gathered for the study were analysed as follows: Hypothesis 1 was tested using Pearson Product Moment Correlation Coefficient (r) while hypotheses,2,3,4,5 and 6 were tested using Fishers Z. The hypotheses were tested using 0.05 alpha level.

    <p>
      Table 1 shows an r value of .136 and a p value of .006, testing at an alpha level of 0.05, the p value is less than the alpha level. So, the null hypothesis which states that “there is no significant relationship among gender ideology, self-concept and participation in adult learning programmes” is rejected. Consequently, there is a significant relationship between gender ideology’s influence on women’s self-concept and their participation in adult learning programme. This suggests that gender ideology has a statistically significant influence on Benin women’s self-concept and their participation in adult learning programmes, though the strength of the relationship is relatively modest. This highlights the importance of gender-sensitive frameworks in adult learning, particularly in culturally embedded contexts like Benin.

    <p>
      Table 2 shows a calculated z value of 2.49 and a z-critical value of 1.96. Testing at alpha level of 0.05, the calculated value falls within the rejection region. So, the null hypothesis which states that “there is no significant difference in the relationship between the influence of Benin gender ideology on women’s self-concept and their participation in planning of adult learning programmes by age” is rejected. Consequently, there is a significant difference in the relationship between the influence of Benin gender ideology on women’s self-concept and their participation in adult learning programme. Since the r value of those below 40years is higher than that of those 40 years and above, it shows that women of age less than 40 years are more influence by the impact of gender ideology on women’s self-concept and their participation in planning of adult learning programme. This suggests that age plays a moderating role in the relationship among gender ideology, self-concept, and participation in adult learning programmes. Specifically, the correlation is stronger among individuals below 40 years compared to those aged 40 years and above. This could indicate that younger women are more responsive to shifts in gender norms and more open to self-improvement through education, possibly due to increased exposure to modern gender discourses or economic necessity.

      Table 3 shows a calculated z value of 0.528 and a z-critical value of 1.96. Testing at an alpha level of 0.05. The calculated z value falls in the acceptance region. So, the null hypothesis which states that “There is no significant difference in the relationship between the influence of Benin gender ideology on women’s self-concept and their participation in the planning of adult learning programmes by marital status” is retained. This implies that marital status does not significantly moderate the relationship among gender ideology, self-concept, and participation in adult learning programmes. It may reflect a uniformity in gender role expectations across marital categories in Benin society, or the growing individual agency of women irrespective of marital roles.

      Hypothesis 1 sought to find out if there is a significant difference in the relationship between the influence gender ideologies have on women’s self-concept and on their participation in adult learning programmes. With an r value of .136 and a p value of .006, testing at an alpha level of 0.05, the p value is less than the alpha level. So, the null hypothesis which states that “there is no significant relationship between gender ideology influence on women’s self-concept and their participation in programme planning in adult learning programmes” is rejected. Consequently, there is a significant relationship between gender ideology’s influence on women’s self-concept and their participation in adult learning programme. According to (Hyde and Kling, 2001) in their paper which provided a review on the impact of gender roles on women involvement in Functional Adult Literacy (FAL) in Ethiopia, contended that women who grew up having the same gender role expectations and behaviours as men are confident and develop positive self-concept about themselves than those who grew up having roles and behaviours different from that of men. It was also argued that the gender roles of women and how they were socialized towards these roles make them think that their roles are appropriate only at home and hence reluctant to be enrolled in the school, less expectant of success and choose those subjects which either provide them the opportunity to fulfill such roles or are consistent with their self-image.

      It is widely accepted that culture is a means through which guidelines for appropriate behaviors, social norms including those related to gender are reflected (Arrindell, 2008). It is through one's culture that gender relation within the society and activities carried out by men and women are determined. That is, it plays a significant role in the construction of gender. Researches indicate that there is close relationship between culture and gender for example, culture and gender are entwined, interdependent and mutually defining to a certain extent. For Coplan in Hofstede (2001), culture and gender are not only related but they have a strong relationship that gender is a "cultural construct." Culture determines what women and men should do; the resources women and men should get including education. Culture plays a significant role in the construction of gender inequality in such a way that men have dominating position in different spheres (Kalkidan, 2007). However, Olomukoro (2013) posits that many studies have demonstrated the benefits of women literacy and education for a county’s overall advancement.

      Hypothesis 2 sought to find out if there is a significant difference in the relationship between the influence of gender ideology on women’s self-concept and their participation in adult learning programmes by age. Since the r value of those below 40years is higher than that of those 40 years and above, it shows that women of age less than 40 years are more influenced by the impact of gender ideology on women’s self-concept and their participation in adult learning programme showing a difference on the influence of gender ideology by age. For instance, in a study on the general effect of gender stereotypes across ages, (Spencer, 2006) found that older adults (60-87 years of age) drew on and maintained gender stereotypic references to a much greater extent than younger adults (18-25 years of age). Similarly, (Suanmali, 2011) support the idea that older individuals are less likely to suppress their prejudiced behavior and are less able to regulate automatically activated associations when compared to younger adults. It should be noted, however, that even when studies supports existing difference in relation to age groups in their respective findings, it is worthy of note that this study reveals younger women to be more influenced than the older women. The researcher’s results thus appear to go against those reporting no reliable differences between young and older adults’ ability to discount gender stereotypical bias.

    <h4><em>Difference in the relationship between the influence of gender ideology on women’s self-concept and their participation in adult learning programmes by marital status.</em></h4>

      Hypothesis 3 sought to find out if there is a significant difference in the relationship between the influence of gender ideology on women’s self-concept and their participation in adult learning programmes by marital status. The calculated z value falls in the acceptance region. So, the null hypothesis which states that “There is no significant difference in the relationship between the influence of Benin gender ideology on women’s self-concept and their participation in the planning of adult learning programmes by marital status” is retained. Meaning marital status does not have significant influence on the relationship between the influence of Benin gender ideology on women’s self-concept and their participation in adult learning programmes. In a study carried out by (Kerka, 2005) Reports from the FGD and complimented with literature review, demographic factors such as age, sex, occupation, social and marital status, religion, previous educational achievement affect adult learners participation in literacy education programmes. Their Field reports also confirmed that learners who are married especially women are affected by domestic responsibilities as well as social responsibility within the community.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      This study highlights the significant influence that demographic variables such as age and marital status have on gender ideology, self-concept, and the participation of Benin women in adult learning programmes in Edo State. It reveals that these factors do not operate in isolation but interact to shape women’s perceptions of themselves, their roles in society, and their willingness or ability to pursue lifelong education. Traditional gender ideologies, when reinforced by certain demographic factors, can act as barriers to women’s educational advancement, while positive self-concept and supportive demographics can serve as powerful motivators for participation.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Understanding these dynamics is essential for the development of responsive adult education policies and programmes that foster inclusivity and empower women. By addressing the demographic realities and cultural challenges faced by Benin women, stakeholders can create educational environments that not only promote skills acquisition but also encourage the redefinition of gender roles and enhance women's agency. Ultimately, promoting greater access to and participation in adult learning programmes will contribute significantly to the broader goals of gender equality, community development, and societal progress in Edo State and beyond.

    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
    <p>Drawing from the findings of this study, the following recommendations are therefore made:</p>
    <ul style={{marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
      <li>Educational initiatives should be designed with sensitivity to the diverse demographic characteristics of Benin women. Programmes should offer flexible schedules, modular learning formats, and targeted content that considers demographic factors such as age, marital status among others.</li>
      <li>Policymakers should develop and implement educational policies that actively challenge restrictive gender ideologies. Such policies must advocate for women's right to education at all life stages and incorporate gender mainstreaming into the design and delivery of adult learning programmes.</li>
      <li>Adult learning programmes should incorporate modules that build women's confidence and self-esteem. Workshops on leadership, public speaking, entrepreneurial skills, and personal development can help reshape self-concept and motivate sustained engagement in learning.</li>
    </ul>
