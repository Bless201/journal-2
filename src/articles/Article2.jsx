    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>In <em>Educational Developments</em> Issue 3.1 (2002), Norman Jackson presented a thorough and thought-provoking analysis of the challenges of engaging staff and institutions in quality enhancement (QE) within the context of Quality Assurance (QA) processes. He argued that the potential benefits of QE would only be achieved if the QA process engages people about thinking hard about what they are doing and why they are doing it. He cautioned that once QA becomes routinised it loses its potency as an aid to self-review and development, and admitted that a significant gap still existed between enhancement and compliance. He presented us with a set of general principles as a guide to how that gap might be closed.</p>
    <br />

    <p>This article provides some additional perspectives on Norman Jackson's analysis by drawing upon work on educational innovation. It offers insights into how we can provide the conditions to engage staff in QE within institutional environments where QA, like RAE, has almost become a mini-industry in the quest to achieve good results. I am aware that since Norman's article a lot has happened in terms of national policy initiatives but my concern here is how we can achieve real change within institutions.</p>

    <h3>Context</h3>
    <p>We know that assessment has a significant influence on student learning. The parallels with institutional assessment and behaviour are striking. The focus on QA for reward tends to push QE to the icing on the cake. The behaviour is almost Pavlovian and one is reminded of the classic behaviourist statement that 'behaviour is determined by its consequences'. Pursuing this behaviourist analogy suggests that the current QA regime needs to be changed to engage and reward greater QE behaviour. In terms of Biggs' (1999) constructive alignment model, we need to be assessing higher-order learning outcomes and generating appropriate learning activity and behaviour. We are yet to see whether the new QA regime is able to do this.</p>
    <br />
    
    <p>This may be too simplistic an analysis as universities are complex organisations with multiple goals and ways of working. We know that facilitating change within universities is notoriously difficult (eg Becher and Kogan, 1992). Behaviorally-driven change management models have limitations in such environments and we need to look at change models which take into account the human and social dimensions of institutional activity. Put another way, how are we going to engage hearts and minds, and facilitate a deep approach to the teaching role rather than a more compliant and minimalist surface approach?</p>
     <br />

    <p>In my experience, new academic staff coming to the usual learning and teaching introductory course are generally keen and motivated to become good teachers. They want to do a good job. Even though one gets a range of reactions to such courses (eg those who want the basic survival kit and those who want some underlying theory or rationale for their teaching), most appear committed to continue to develop their teaching. However, as the process of socialisation into their own departmental cultures occurs these good intentions give way to other priorities. In a research-led university, the RAE is a priority and competes heavily for time. The demands of teaching are also such that development can get edged out to a survival approach.</p>
    <br />

    <p>All the usual suspects are present, e.g lack of priority given to teaching, rewards systems which do not value teaching as much as research, little time or recognition for teaching development activities. In spite of the higher profile of QA and its impact on institutions, and of institutional learning and teaching strategies, the management of disciplinary groups, especially in a research-led environment, feel that that they have to favour the reputational activities of scholarship and research, and to protect time for them. Under these circumstances engaging people in QE through QA is challenging.</p>
    <br />

    <p>The reality at the chalk face does not give one grounds for optimism. Awareness of quality policies and issues tends not to be all that high except for those involved in relevant quality committees. The vast volume of QA procedural and related documentation is off-putting and is written in a style which is far from clear and engaging, and appears to have low face validity for many as far as academic practice is concerned. This is possibly unsurprising as it tends to be written by those not directly engaged in teaching and learning. Anyway, universities have various people and units who can answer quality questions related to procedures, so academic staff need not engage with the material directly.</p>

    <h3>QA 'Speak' a Barrier to QE?</h3>
    <p>The volume, clarity and style of much QA material are a concern. For example, take the development of assessment strategies. The QAA Code of Practice (2000) document lacks a sense of theoretical and practical coherence to those charged with writing an assessment strategy. The LTSN Generic Learning and Teaching Centre (Mutch and Brown, 2001) attempted to produce a more coherent guide. It is a better written document but becomes overwhelmed by numerous checklist points in its quest to convey clarity and practical guidance.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Writing credible and clear QA procedural guides is a craft. They need to possess a convincing rationale which articulates with the reality of academic practice and to offer practical examples. If they do not, disengagement is likely to follow with the adoption of surface learning behaviour and a tick-box mentality. The development of programme specifications perhaps provided an ideal opportunity to link QA to QE by stimulating fundamental reviews of curricula along the lines of the principles of constructive alignment.</p>
    <br />

    <p>However, the rationale and guidance provided left many staff unsure and skeptical of why and how they should be proceeding in this way. There are also many real and unresolved issues regarding, say, the use of learning outcomes which many teachers feel require further debate (eg Hussey and Smith, 2002). Typically, quality units issue instructions and highlight the importance of meeting deadlines for the production of programme specifications. While educational developers might offer workshops on the principles of programme specifications, I suspect that in many cases they do not form part of a coherent institutional strategy for quality enhancement. Heads of department and other institutional managers tend to think primarily of meeting deadlines rather than engaging staff in enhancement debates. Programme specifications simply need to be produced to satisfy an external agency's requirements.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Perhaps this is an exaggerated view of reality but it does highlight worrying trends towards teaching staff disengagement with QA matters and the lack of strategic leadership exhibited by academic managers in the quest to meet short-term political objectives. Possibly a redeeming feature for QA and QE is the development of SEDA and ILT-accredited programmes in many institutions for new teaching staff. Such courses provide an opportunity for long-term engagement in initial professional development which can lead to a deeper understanding of the educational issues and a genuine stimulus for taking a more professional and informed view of teaching and learning. Some departments view the products of such courses as the new 'experts' in learning and teaching, and as people they can rely upon to translate the jargon of QA and provide guidance and consultancy on local teaching policy and practice.</p>

    <h3>An Innovation Perspective</h3>
    <p>In their study of radical innovations in Swedish universities, Berg and Ostergren (1977) employed Lewin's (1951) systems perspective as an analytical framework. They postulated four decisive factors which were likely to explain the relative success or failure of such innovations: power, gain/loss, ownership and leadership. Using their framework can provide useful insights into both the problems and opportunities associated with getting higher education teachers engaged in QE.</p>
    <br />

    <p>In terms of power, the QA regime represents a driver towards compliance in terms of departmental and institutional reward (ie favourable ratings which find their way into league tables). QE drivers are difficult to locate. Innovatory teaching is recognised but not necessarily rewarded. If it is too innovatory, it is perhaps even frowned upon in case it falls outside QA expectations. What should be primarily developmental activities, such as staff appraisal, observation of teaching and student feedback, are increasingly used as crude performance measures of individual teachers in the quest to assure quality and standards by managers. This can weaken trust, collegiality, openness and risk-taking.</p>
    <br />

    <p>In terms of gains and losses for the individual, there are personal gains of professional satisfaction, improved efficiency and improved student learning which are more widespread than the small bands of usual enthusiasts might indicate. Many staff work on their teaching relatively quietly possibly because they do not wish to be identified as teaching enthusiasts! Some institutions have teaching award schemes which recognise excellence and perhaps reward it with money and development time. But on the downside, there is rarely time formally recognised for teaching development, let alone teaching preparation. The allowance for preparation in workload management schemes tends to be minimal. New staff in particular can feel vulnerable under these regimes. In workshops I run on lecture preparation, many new teachers report that they typically spend two days for every hour of lecture preparation. To admit this in a department can suggest lack of competence. Spending time on developing quality teaching and learning, especially in a research-intensive environment, does not get one promotion.</p>
    <br />

    <p>In terms of ownership, QA can bring a sense of disenfranchisement over academic experience and judgement in teaching matters. A well-meaning bureaucratic QA industry has gradually evolved which appears to many teachers to issue guidelines on policy and practice with little by way of real consultation with practitioners and the reality of their experience, and by being not particularly informed by academic scholarship and research into higher education teaching. Local managers may fume at more impositions but life is too short to create a fuss and so they unconsciously collude to disengage academic practitioners from challenging QA demands and engaging in the QA debate.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Educational developers to the rescue? Possibly, but in some institutions their status has been eroded in favour of strengthening QA units to ensure that external requirements are met. Professional administrators rather than academic practitioners or educational developers increasingly advise institutional learning and teaching policy bodies perhaps because they are felt to be a safer pair of hands politically in QA terms. Even QE support functions (eg professional development) have become increasingly subsumed within the professional administrative sector, which arguably removes them from their roots and ownership in academic practice. Implicitly, this can send a message that QA and QE are things that are done to academics rather than with them or by them.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Institutional and local leadership should ideally be able to stand back from the detail, see the bigger picture and inspire a way forward towards strategically and credibly coherent outcomes. With the pressures many universities are under, high quality leadership and management would seem vital in terms of creating a vision, signing people up to it and constructing a practical and effective strategy for achieving agreed goals. The politicised environment in which universities operate has led to a more political style of leadership and management in many institutions. The rhetoric of goals, targets and strategies often gives way to the quick fix.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Maybe this is understandable in response to changing external demands and the survival instinct, but it undermines deep thought and reflection, and the achievement of long-term meaningful goals.</p>
    <br />

    <p>As well as the head of department, there is now an infrastructure of leaders and management co-ordinators for learning and teaching in most institutions. My observation is that many are part-time, are mostly occupied with dealing with the demands of QA and have little by way of recognition or status. At the institutional level we still have some way to go in conceptualizing and implementing effective strategies for learning and teaching in a co-ordinated way and linking these holistically to other institutional strategies.</p>
    <br />

    <p>The above analysis suggests that the long-standing issues of recognition and reward for teaching, and time for development remain in a system where there are increasing demands on an academic's time. QA demands have failed to engage practitioners in a deep sense and there are increasing tensions as traditional development activities are increasingly used as evidence of performance. Institutional investment in QE has tended to migrate towards strengthening QA systems which are often managed centrally. At the same time, academic ownership of QA, and increasingly of QE support processes, has been weakened.</p>
    <br />

    <p>The one optimistic QE development is that of SEDA- and ILT-accredited programmes for new lecturers which are typically run by educational developers or education academics, and which are underpinned by scholarship and research, and encourage a critical, reflective and questioning attitude. Such programmes could well be a Trojan Horse in providing well-informed university teachers with the understanding and confidence to influence the QA and QE debates. We should not forget SEDA's pioneering work in this area and the impetus it is continuing to provide in the whole area of accredited professional development. This is a good example of practitioners taking control of the agenda.</p>

    <h3>Possible Ways Forward</h3>
    <p>Against this reality, Norman Jackson's analysis and recommendations appear idealistic. However, it is easier to provide a critique than it is to offer positive solutions. The solutions are not quick or easy as they tend to be systemic and reflect how perceptions of environments within which people work can influence their approach to what they do and how they do it, eg compare the research on students' experiences of their course environments and their approaches to learning (Ramsden, 1992).</p>
    <br />

    <p>I have selected three key solutions to engage staff positively in QE. The first involves simply dealing with the long-overdue problem of providing recognition and reward for teaching in promotions criteria, coupled with providing genuine time for teaching development. The Government's recent White Paper on The Future of Higher Education (Department for Education and Skills, 2003) identifies this as a priority, which may drive some institutions to giving it a sense of urgency.</p>
    <br />

    <p>The second involves building positively on the success of the SEDA and ILT-accredited programmes for new lecturers, influenced by SEDA's innovatory work, initiated by the Dearing Report (1997) in the context of professionalising teaching and recognising it as a scholarly activity. We need to place a greater emphasis on Continuing Professional Development (CPD) and one way of elevating its importance is through some form of accreditation scheme. Such a scheme needs to be simple to operate and not unduly burdensome. SEDA has already initiated work in this area but credit-bearing CPD provision through institutional validation may prove an attractive option for some staff who want the value and currency of credit to contribute towards a recognised qualification.</p>
    <br />

    <p>There are issues to resolve, however, if staff are to feel a sense of ownership over their own CPD. There are tensions between institutional human resources and learning and teaching strategies. While the human resources function needs to concern itself with the delivery of its corresponding institutional strategy, institutional restructuring has tended to bring the educational development function within human resources operation and removed it from an academic and scholarship base. If CPD is to articulate genuinely with academic practice, feel collegial and credible, and be informed by scholarship and research, educational development needs to be relocated where it has always belonged — within an academic rather than an administrative environment.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Finally, we need to professionalise the management of teaching and learning so that those responsible for key areas of educational strategy and delivery, whether it be the course coordinator, faculty leader or pro-vice-chancellor, can exercise informed and strategic leadership. Educational management in higher education seems to me to be a neglected area and typically has low status and recognition. Yet, potentially, it can have considerable systemic impact in promoting innovation and development, and enabling people to work together more effectively in a joined-up way. More importantly, many of these positions are held by academics who should be able to make that vital connection with academic practice and facilitate linkages between QA and QE.</p>
    <br />
    
    <p>Ramsden's study (1998) of leadership in higher education offers some useful links between research on the impact of departmental environments on students' approaches to learning, and the wider impact organisational environments have on teachers' approaches to teaching and how these impact on students. As he observes: 'Good academic leadership should help create an environment for academics to learn how to teach better: an environment where interest in teaching is nurtured, and where solving educational problems collaboratively is routine' (p64). But this can only happen if there is clear leadership from the very top of the institution — and maybe performance-related pay to go with it!</p>

    <h3>End Note</h3>
    <p>As I completed this piece, the Cooke Report (2003) was published which proposed, among other things, the establishment of a new Academy for Advancement of Learning and Teaching in Higher Education. No doubt there will be much debate about its implications but for the purposes of this article, it is interesting simply to compare the above analysis with some of the Report's observations:</p>

    <div className="quote-box" style={{backgroundColor: '#f5f5f5', padding: '15px', margin: '15px 0', fontStyle: 'italic'}}>
