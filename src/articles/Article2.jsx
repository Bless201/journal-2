    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p className="abstract">
      This study examined the effects of menstruation on aerobic power among Ogun State female endurance athletes. Two research questions and hypotheses were formulated to guide the study. The 1x2x3 factorial research design was adopted for this study, and the population consists of all Ogun State female endurance athletes. The multistage research sample techniques were adopted for the study, which consist of purposive and stratified sampling techniques. The sample size for the study consists of 20 active female endurance athletes that have represented, and are still representing Ogun State within and outside the State in different categories of athletic events. All measurements; 12 minutes run/walk and collection of blood sample were conducted at the Moshood Kshimawo Olanbiwunninun (MKO) Stadium for a period of 8 weeks, collecting data on blood parameter; Bicarbonate concentration. The descriptive statistics of mean and standard deviation were used to analyze the demographic data, while, inferential statistics of t-test and Analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to test the stated hypotheses at 0.05 level of significance. The findings of the study revealed that menstruation has influence on the aerobic power ((t=6.23; p&lt;0.05), it also indicate that, menstruation has influence on the bicarbonate concentration among Ogun State female endurance athletes. In conclusion, Menstruation was found to have effect on the aerobic power and sodium bicarbonate concentration among Ogun State female endurance athletes.

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      The continuous existence of mammals is brought about by reproduction, a process that produces new offspring. Reproduction can be classify into asexual and sexual; the asexual form of reproduction is common to plants while sexual is commonly found among mammals and human of all species.  After birth,  a child under go both physical and physiological maturation which reflects in the development of pubic air and breast, change in weight and height and more importantly, the shedding of monthly blood, often referred to as ‘menses’. Menstruation  is commonly referred to as menses, menstrual period, cycle or period. It is a unique social factor that determines to a large the continuous existence of families and human races that is not openly discussed. To many menstruating adolescents and adults, it is a painful experience they often find difficult to discuss with their employer and friends out of stigmatization. In 2019 for instance, a menstruating female workers at Michi kake store in Osaka, Japan where sexual products and menstrual products are sold were asked to wear a badge with a cartoon called Seri Chan (meaning Miss Period). Hence, most women find it difficult to discuss their menstrual difficulties with their heads/boss at work because they might be labeled as being lazy or lack the ability for effective job performance.

    <br />

    <p>The menstrual blood is partly blood, and partly tissue from the inside of the uterus flows, from the uterus through the cervix and out of the body through the vagina (Cleveland Clinic, 2022). Women experience menstruation in different forms which is often occasioned by singular or multifaceted factors. Menstruation is the elimination of the thickened lining of the uterus (endometrium) from the body through the vagina. Menstrual fluid contains blood, cells from the lining of the uterus (endometrial cells) and mucus. The average length of a period is between three days and one week. Menstruation occurs on a monthly cycle throughout female reproductive life (Yeovil District Hospital, 2018). Menstruation is a unique social factor that plays significant role in the attainment of healthy life and overall well being, it is a complex and a major factor that is being controlled by several hormones and glands. During moderate and high intensive aerobic exercise, athletes lost large volume of electrolytes through sweat which tends to increase during their menstruation, hence, significant volume of micronutrients exits during each menstrual process some of which include iron, nitrogen calcium chloride and others. The findings of Okesanya, (2023) established that, the menstrual blood consists of calcium, sodium, chloride, potassium and bicarbonate.</p>
    <br />

    <p>As women approach the age of forty-five, there is high tendency for their monthly flow to reduce, this was upheld by the submission of Sonya, Sunni, Anna, Neil, Donald, Jean and Enrique, (2012) who opined that, menstruation is often irregular among women of early and late reproductive ages, but its variability among women of mid-reproductive age remains unclear. Dysmenorhea is a common form of menstrual disorder that is associated with different types of pains such as prolong abdominal and pelvic cramp, back pains, headache, fatigue, and lots more. Jacob, (2017) affirmed that, painful menstruation known as dysmenorrhea is one of the most common women’s problems which begin during adolescence, usually within four to five years of the first menstrual period, and it is characterized by severe and frequent menstrual cramps, and pain associated with menstruation (Summa Health, 2020).</p>
    <br />

    <p>Eunice, (2017) established that menstrual irregularities can have a variety of causes, including pregnancy, hormonal imbalances, infections, diseases, trauma, and certain medications. In the opinion of Corrine, (2020), menstrual cycle disorder can result from conditions that affect the vagina, ovaries cervix, and more importantly, athletic performance. As women approach the age of forty-five, there is high tendency for their monthly flow to reduce, this was upheld by the submission of Sonya, Sunni, Anna, Neil, Donald, Jean and Enrique, (2012) who opined that, menstruation is often irregular among women of early and late reproductive ages, but its variability among women of mid-reproductive age remains unclear.

It has also been found that aerobic ability and muscle power differ over phases of the menstrual cycle (Freemas et al., 2021; Pallavi et al., 2017), equally, was established that female athletes are predisposed to knee injury at certain phases of their menstrual cycle (Hewett et al., 2007; Oleka, 2020). Blood play significant role in the regular process of menstrual flow among the female athletes.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Blood is one of the most important components of life, and obviously, every animal that possess circulatory system has blood. From an evolutionary perspective, blood was speculated to have risen from a type of cell that was responsible for phagocytosis and nutrition (Ankit, 2022). The constancy of the composition of blood is made possible by the circulation, which conveys blood through the organs that regulate the concentrations of its components, in the lungs, blood acquires oxygen and releases carbon dioxide transported from the tissues (Conley, 2021). The human blood cells are formed in the bone marrow, and usually, starts as a stem cell otherwise known as hematopoietic cell, which often form the early stage of all the blood cells. Blood is both a tissue and a fluid: It is a tissue because it is a collection of similar specialized cells that serve specialized functions which are suspended in a liquid matrix called (plasma), which makes the blood a fluid (Robert, 2021), and  the sole medium of communication between and among various cells, tissues and organs, and also prevent excessive lost of blood both internally and externally. It is a crimson fluid that flows from the human body after a cut or a significant injury. Blood’s composition is incredibly complicated, Blood is actually the delivery medium for dissolved gases, nutrients, hormones, and more (Michael, 2022). The ability of an adolescent to enjoy regular menstrual flow depend on multidimensional variables but principally, depends on the quality and quantity of blood it possess.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Menstruation is the elimination of the thickened lining of the uterus (endometrium) from the body through the vagina. Menstrual fluid contains blood, cells from the lining of the uterus (endometrial cells) and mucus. The average length of a period is between three days and one week. Menstruation occurs on a monthly cycle throughout female reproductive life (Yeovil District Hospital, 2018). Menstruation is a unique social factor that plays significant role in the attainment of healthy life and overall well being, it is a complex and a major factor that is being controlled by several hormones and glands. During moderate and high intensive aerobic exercise, athletes lost large volume of electrolytes through sweat which tends to increase during their menstruation, hence, significant volume of micronutrients exits during each menstrual process some of which include iron, nitrogen calcium chloride and others.  However, significant percentage of these elements can be derive the food we consume,  in minor quantity but are greatly essential  for multifaceted roles they perform within and outside the cells. when not being replaced could lead to gradual and total breakdown in the body function.  The findings of Okesanya, (2023) established that, the menstrual blood consists of calcium, sodium, chloride, potassium and bicarbonate.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) is considered as an effective ergogenic supplement for improving high-intensity exercise capacity and performance, available data are consistent in showing (Bryan et al, 2022). Sodium bicarbonate is a compound used for the symptomatic treatment of heartburn, acid indigestion, and upset stomach as well as the treatment of metabolic acidosis associated with conditions such as severe renal disease and circulatory insufficiency due to shock.(3: go.drug). It has been proposed as a performance enhancing aid by reducing acidosis during exerscise,  the duration of exercise might be influential for inducing a performance enhancing effect when supplementing bicarbonate but to which extent, remains unclear due to the inconsistencies in the study results (Miralem, Max, & Monique, 2019). Blood Bicarbonate is part of the acid base homeostatic bicarbonate buffer system, which is critical in regulating blood pH concentrations and supporting metabolic functions. Blood pH is too alkaline a proton (H+), and dissolves from carbonic acid bicarbonate forming. On the contrary, blood bicarbonate helps to bind proton if blood pH is too acidic, resulting in bicarbonate again dissociating into water and carbon dioxide. This leads to increased breathing rate, in an attempt to exhale CO2 and restore acid-base balance.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Sodium bicarbonate appears to influence phosphocreatine degradation (PCr) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) accumulation [(PCr/ (Pi)], glycolytic intermediates (muscle protons and lactate), intra- and extracellular distribution of metabolites and other strong ions (Na+, K + and Cl) which appear to contribute to a performance enhancing effect (Siegler et al., 2016). Studies have shown that bicarbonate may not only be an ergogenic, but also an ergolytic substance (Deb et al., 2018). This may be due to the fact that, the bicarbonate buffer system is not solely responsible for blood pH but is also vital in other systems, such as the stomach and duodenum by neutralizing gastric   acid. As a sensitive contributor to those multifactorial processes, a potential limitation of performance is possible. Participants supplementing NaHCO3 reported gastrointestinal (GI) upset including nausea, stomach pain, diarrhea and vomiting (Saunders et al., 2014; Carr et al., 2011b). Sodium bicarbonate appears to influence phosphocreatine degradation (PCr) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) accumulation [(PCr/ (Pi)], glycolytic intermediates (muscle protons and lactate), intra- and extracellular distribution of metabolites and other strong ions (Na+, K + and Cl) which appear to contribute to performance enhancing effect (Siegler et al., 2016).</p>
    <br />

    <p>Furthermore,  six studies with exercise duration of more than four minutes showed no effects while supplementing acutely (Christensen et al., 2014). Out of the 35 studies included in this systematic review seventeen RCT’s were acutely supplementing with, during an exercise duration of ≤ 4 minutes. Nine of these studies were clearly showing performance enhancing results after bicarbonate supplementation. In addition, three trials were showing divergent results even when using the same protocol. In these studies, bicarbonate resulted in enhanced performance after supplementation only for one exercise task (Painelli et al., 2013; Duncan et al., 2014) or only in combination with beta-alanine (Painelli et al., 2013) or caffeine (Felippe et al., 2016). While various exercises were tested, greatest results were shown during swimming freestyle (2.4% performance increase) (Mero et al., 2013; Siegler & Gleadall-Siddall). It also recommends the implementation of menstrual cycle protocols and educational developments within sports-specific circles in an attempt to minimize negative impact and to maximize positive outcomes for athletes(Brown et al., 2021; Findlay et al., 2020).</p>
    <br />

    <p>Shahzaman, (2021) explained that, the physiological job of minerals is significant for players, taking note of that minerals are engaged with muscle constriction, heart rhythm, nerve impulses, oxygen transportation, protein initiation, cell reinforcement, movement, and bone health. It explained further that, since a significant number of these procedures are quickened during physical activity, a satisfactory amount of minerals is important for ideal working of athletes. Similarly, Shahzaman, (2021) conducted a study to analyze the effect of mineral intake on physical fitness components of and to determine the association between physical fitness and sports performance of female athletes, the result revealed,  significant effect of mineral intake on strength, endurance, flexibility and speed. women experience menstruation in different forms which is often occasioned by singular or multifaceted factors. Eunice, (2017) established that menstrual irregularities can have a variety of causes, including pregnancy, hormonal imbalances, infections, diseases, trauma, and certain medications. In the opinion of Corrine, (2020), menstrual cycle disorder can result from conditions that affect the vagina, ovaries cervix, and more importantly, athletic performance. However, the comfort of discomfort of every menstruation has direct implications on the individual physical capacity and athletic prerformance. Research has found that female athletes are predisposed to knee injury at certain phases of their menstrual cycle (Hewett et al., 2007; Oleka, 2020). It has also been found that aerobic ability and muscle power differ over phases of the menstrual cycle (Freemas et al., 2021; Pallavi et al., 2017).</p>
    <br />

    <p>Physical performance is an essential characteristic of every human, designed to develop and maintain its structures. Participation in active physical exercise often require the use of large muscles, and these muscles function more efficiently and effectively when they are well supplied with  the required volume of oxygen which serves as the main source of fuel to enable it, and to be able to accomplish its physical and physiological task. To sustain this effort, athletes/performer consistently engaged in training to develop and maintain a standard aerobic capacity. Aerobic power of athletes is an important element of success in sports achievements. Physiologically, it is the functional capacity of an organism to increase the level of metabolic process in keeping with the requirement of physical effort being exposed to. Even though, over training can lead to the cessation of menstruation which, in turn, has been linked to recurring injuries such as stress fractures and early onset osteoporosis (Nattiv, 2007; Southmayd et al., 2019)</p>
    <br />

    <p>The individual’s aerobic capacity provides broad base platform for determining or calculate for an athlete, with a higher VO2max; the ability to absorb, transport and use oxygen during exercise, which the central component involves the ability of the lungs, heart and vascular system to deliver oxygen to the muscles via the blood stream. The secondary component however, involves the ability of the muscle cells to extract oxygen from the blood and use it to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the fundamental carrier of energy in cells (Livestrong Foundation, 2022). The high aerobic capacity is necessary to maintain high intensity, whole body physical exercise for several minutes, and a chain of the oxygen delivery and mitochondrial consumption can be a rate-limiting of the aerobic functional system (Apors & Borka, 2002). Maximal oxygen uptake, which can also be termed V̇O2max, is determined by both the amount of oxygen in the blood and the oxygen consumption of skeletal muscle (Schmidt & Prommer, 2010). As the transport of oxygen in blood is dependent on haemoglobin, this is clearly dependent on sufficient iron availability. Like other aerobic fitness parameters oxygen uptake kinetics also determine the individual cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory efficiency during sub maximal exercises.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Thus, athletes endowed with faster VO2 kinetics will have better aerobic fitness than athletes who have slower VO2 kinetics. Åstrand and Rodahl, (1970) cited in Tasew, (2020) explained the impact that training has on one’s ability to maintain a certain percentage of V ˙O2max during prolonged exercise. Trained individuals functioned at 87% and 83% of V˙O2max for 1 and 2h, respectively, compared with only 50% and 35% of V˙O2max for the untrained subjects. During endurance exercise, the production of sweat for purposes of thermoregulation results in significant losses of body water, as well as fluctuating between acidic and alkaline base. To this end, sodium bicarbonate  greatly help in removing the excess hydrogen in the muscles that often cause burning sensation athletes do experience during sprint and anaerobic exercise to  facilitate efficient uptake of needed oxygen. Maximal oxygen uptake, which can also be termed V̇O2max, is determined by both the amount of oxygen in the blood and the oxygen consumption of skeletal muscle (Schmidt & Prommer, 2010). As the transport of oxygen in blood is dependent on haemoglobin, this is clearly dependent on sufficient iron availability. Vo2max or maximal oxygen consumption is the greatest quantity of oxygen that a person may consume when engaging in vigorous exercise (Oxford University Press, 2022).</p>
    <br />

    <p>Against the old practice, today’s women compete with their male counterparts in different fields of endeavors including sports and games at different level/category of competitions. Though menstruation is a natural phenomenon that cut across all female adults, but the effects on the individuals differ; while some feel fairly comfortable within the period, a good number of them experience series of abdominal discomfort, psychological and emotional imbalance occasioned by different forms of pain with resultant effect on general body weakness. Besides, a good number of athletes had in recent time attributed menstrual discomfort as a major reason for staying out of competitions without any good substitute in most cases.  For instance, Geetika, (2020) reported that, in 2016, a Chinese swimmer Fu Yuahul told reporters at the Summer Olympic after she won a bronze that ‘’her menses started last night” making her to feel pretty weak and really tired, and at the end of the day, she could not swim well. Despite the fact that some women observe the monthly bleed uninterrupted, personal observation has also shown that a good number of them do experience fluctuation during performance and yet, no much research has established the effect menstruation has on the aerobic power on the physical performance of the female athlete. Jacky, (2018) assert that, whether menstrual cycle can positively or negatively affect performance is still a debate. Based on the above observation, the researcher aimed to investigate the Effects Menstruation could have on Bicarbonate concentration on female endurance athletes of Ogun State.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Two research questions and hypotheses were formulated to guide the study.</p>

      <li>Menstruation will have no significant effect on the bicarbonate concentration of female endurance athletes of Ogun State.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>METHODOLOGY</h3>

    <h4>Research Design</h4>
    <p>The factorial research design was adopted for the study. In this form of design, the menstruating female athletes were the focus of the study. The participants were subjected to 12 minutes run/work, and on the completion of the run/walk, sample of their blood were taken. The sample of their blood will be taken (Pre) before and during the menstrual period to determine the effects of menstruation on the aerobic power among Ogun State female endurance athletes.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Population of the study</h4>
    <p>The population for the study consists of all the elite female endurance athletes of Ogun State.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Sample and Sampling Technique</h4>
    <p>The sample for this study consists of 20 Ogun State female endurance athletes, selected from the population. The participants were active athletes, and readily available, and they have participated and represented Ogun State in organized competition within and outside Ogun State. A purposive and stratified (multistage) sampling technique was used in the selection of the elite athletes.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Inclusion criteria: only those who are medically fit and active in sport were allowed to participate in the study, and were also in their menstrual age.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Exclusion criteria: All those who were ill and with menstrual pains were not allowed to participate in the study.</p>
    <br />

   <h4>Instrument</h4>
    <p>The following instruments were used for data collection.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Whistle: The Champion whistle model—Fox 40 classic was used to start the event.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Stopwatch: Kadio Electronic Model KD 1063 was used for timimg.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Data Sheet: This was used to record the parameters of the athletes and performance.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Weighing Scale: Model 2650KL Health-O-Meter digital electronic platform scale was used to measure the weight of the partoicipants in Kilogram (kg).</p>
    <br />

    <p>Standiometer: SECA 213 mobile standiometer was used to measure the stretch height of the participants in meters (m).</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Pilot Study</h4>
    <p>The researcher carried out a pilot study using five female students from the Department of Human Kinetics Sports & Health Education of Lagos State University, Ojo, Lagos State. This is essential to enable the researcher and his assistants have adequate mastery of the procedure involved in the test and measurements of the study.</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Procedure for Data Collection</h4>
    <p>All participants assembled at MKO Stadium Abeokuta, Ogun State. The purpose of the study was explained to the participants, and consent form was distributed to indicate their                                                                                                                                                                        intention/interest and readiness/willingness to take part in the study. They were equally asked to indicate their date/time of next menstruation on the the form. The participants blood samples were taken twice, Pre and During the menstrual cycle. For the Pre, the blood samples of all the participants were taken on same day. Since menstrual time differs among female individuals and athletes, a roster was prepared. Thus, any athlete that feels the sign or coming of her menses, will call the researcher or inform the most senior athletes among them. Based on this information, the Laboratory Technologist was adequately informed, and the following morning, the participants were moved to the Stadium for the collection of their blood samples after the 12 minutes run/walk. There were two auxiliary nurses and one Laboratory Technologist among these athletes who assisted in confirming the acclaimed menstrual status of these athletes. The samples of blood withdrawn were immediately taken to the Ogun State Hospital Laboratory, for immediate analysis. This equally applies to those whose menses start on weekend; the samples of their blood were taken and kept in the Hospital laboratory refrigerator. It is pertinent to point out that, coaches athletes and the researcher were not allowed to touch neither the carton where the tube of the blood samples were arranged nor the tube itself. The researcher however, made use of four (4) research assistants that helped tremendously in achieving the targeted outcome. All measurement and performance test were carried out within the Moshood Kashimawo Olambiwonninu (MKO) Stadium Complex, Abeokuta, Ogun State, while blood sample were taken by Laboratory Technologists in Ogun State Hospital.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Weight: Each participant stepped on the weighing scale barefooted, and eyes looking straight, and the body weight was recorded in Kilogram (Kg).</p>
    <br />

    <p>Height: Participant stood erect with Sport Pants, looking straight, and without canvas/snicker. The participant stood with heels, while the buttock and back lean on the measuring bar. Looking straight ahead, the Frankfort plank was placed on vertex of the head in line with the measuring bar. The height was then taken and recorded in meters (m).</p>
    <br />

    <h4>Procedure for Performance Test</h4>
    <br />

    <p>Maximal aerobic speed (MAS)</p>
    <br />

    <p>The Cooper 12 minutes run: To test aerobic fitness (V02 max).</p>
    <br />

    <p>Equipment: Running track, marker cones, recording sheets, and stop watch.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Procedure: Markers was placed at set intervals around the track to aid in measuring the completed distance. Participants’ ran for 12minutes, and the total distance covered was recorded. Though, walking is allowed but, participants must be encouraged to push themselves as hard as possible to maximize distance covered.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Scoring: The distance covered in 12minutes was recorded in minutes and seconds</p>

    <p>It could be observed from table 2 above that a significant t-value (t=6.23; P&lt;0.05) was obtained at 0.05 level of significance. Therefore, hypothesis one which states that menstruation will have no significant effect on the aerobic power of female endurance athletes of Ogun State was rejected. This implies that menstruation had significant effect on the aerobic power of female endurance athletes of Ogun State. This can be buttressed by the significant lower aerobic power (1902.55) recorded during menstruation as compared with that recorded before menstruation. The lower aerobic power recorded during menstruation as compared with that before menstruation is a clear attestation to the extent to which menstruation affects aerobic power of female athletes. This finding corroborate the result of Freemas, Baranauskas, Constantini, Constantini, Greenshields, Mickleborough, Raglin, & Schlader, (2021) who reported that, menstruation has been shown to influence aerobic performance in trained and untrained women, they added that, trained women experience reduced aerobic capacity (measured as VO2 peak) during their luteal phase, and untrained women experience a reduced cycling power output during their mid-luteal phase.</p>

    <h3>Discussion</h3>
    
    <p>In testing hypothesis one, a significant t-value was obtained at 0.05 level of significance. Therefore, hypothesis one as stated was rejected. This implies that menstruation had a significant effect on the aerobic power of female endurance athletes of Ogun State. The lower aerobic power recorded during menstruation as compared with that before menstruation is a clear attestation to the extent to which menstruation affects aerobic power of female athletes. This finding corroborate the result of Freemas, Baranauskas, Constantini, Constantini, Greenshields, Mickleborough, Raglin, & Schlader, (2020) who reported that, menstruation has been shown to influence aerobic performance in trained and untrained women, they added that, trained women experience reduced aerobic capacity (measured as VO2 peak) during their luteal phase, and untrained women experience a reduced cycling power output during their mid-luteal phase. Similarly, Mujika and Taipale, (2019) explained that, it is well known that the physiology of women is unique and largely influenced by the menstrual cycle, while the primary function of oestrogen and progesterone is to support reproduction, the changing concentrations of these hormones across the menstrual cycle have also been found to affect a number of physiological systems, which in turn could have implications on sport performance.  Similarly, Karacan and Guny, (2003), investigate the effects of menstruation and pre-menstrual syndrome on performance in short and high level exercise parameters such as, attention, concentration, speed and promptness and found that, general coordination, anaerobic power, vertical jump  and 30m sprint values were found to be significant after menstruation period when compared to premenstrual and menstrual phase (p&lt;0.05). In a similar view, Tremback-Ballet et al., (2021) observed that, a female athlete may be just as fit as her male counterpart, yet, it is recognized the menstrual  cycle has unique physiological effects on athletic performance. Buttressing the above assertions, (Ingel et al., (2017) reported that,  there have been several cases where athletes have cited their menstrual cycle to be  the cause for their poor athletic performance in the press.</p>
    <br />

    <p>Further more, hypothesis two was equally tested at 0.05 level of significance, and a significant t-value was obtained. Thus, hypothesis two as stated was rejected. This implies that menstruation had a significant effect on the Bicarbonate concentration of female endurance athletes of Ogun State. The above can be substantiated by the significant higher bicarbonate concentration recorded during menstruation as compared with that recorded before it. The result establish the findings of Bryan, Launa, Emear, Krzysztof, Lars, M., Guilherme, & Paul, (2022) who submitted that sodium bicarbonate is considered as an effective ergogenic supplement for improving high-intensity exercise capacity and performance. More so, Miralem, Max, and Monique, (2019) reported that bicarbonate has been proposed as a performance enhancing aid by reducing acidosis during exercise, the duration of exercise might be influential for inducing a performance enhancing effect when supplementing bicarbonate but to which extent, remains unclear due to the inconsistencies in the study results (Miralem, Max, and Monique, 2019). More so, Miralem, Max, and Monique, (2019) reported that, bicarbonate has been proposed as a performance enhancing aid by reducing acidosis during exercise,  the duration of exercise might be influential for inducing a performance enhancing effect when supplementing bicarbonate but to which extent, remains unclear due to the inconsistencies in the study results (Miralem, Max, and Monique, 2019). Thus, as training demands shift during the year, athletes need to adjust their calorie intake and micronutrient distribution while maintaining a high nutrient dense diet that support their training and competition nutrients needs (American Dietetic Association; Dietitians of Canada; American College of Sport Medicine, 2009). Despite the small amount of available data, results are consistent in showing that Sodium Bicarbonate supplementation in women leads to large changes in blood bicarbonate and that, there is strong evidence for a positive ergogenic effect on exercise performance that is likely to be small to medium in magnitude (Brayan, Laguna, Elimear, & Paul, 2021).</p>
    <br />

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>In conclusion, the results of the findings revealed that Menstruation has effect on the aerobic power and among Ogun State female endurance athletes. It also indicate that, menstruation had influence on the bicarbonate concentration among Ogun State female endurance athletes. In conclusion, Menstruation was found to have effect on both the aerobic power and sodium bicarbonate concentration among Ogun State female endurance athletes.</p>
    <br />

    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
    <p>Based on the findings of this study, it is recommended that:</p>
    <ol style={{marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '20px'}}>
      <li>Coaches should create positive relationship with their athletes so as to be able to understand their attitudes during their premenstrual and menstrual period.</li>
      <li>Similarly, coaches should create awareness among the athletes on the need to take/eat food that contains the right quality of nutrients/electrolytes in other for them to maintain the intra and extra fluidity of the cells during training and competition.</li>
      <li>Besides, coaches need to work closely with their athletes for them to have accurate records of their menstrual time to aid his/her training plan.</li>
    </ol>
