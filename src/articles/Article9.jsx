    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p className="abstract">
      Malaria disease is one of the leading contributors to deaths around the globe. The pervasive effect is more severe in Sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, this study x-rays the health belief model as a predictor of mothers’ intention to utilize insecticide treated nets (ITNs).
      The survey research design was adopted for this study. The population of this study included mothers who attend prenatal and post natal Care centers in the 424 registered health centers in Edo State.
      The sample for the study was 180 participants selected through multi-stage sampling technique.
      The instrument used for the study was a questionnaire. The reliability of the instrument was analyzed with Pearson product moment correlation coefficient which yields Pearson r of 0.85. The data was analyzed with hierarchical multiple regression.
      This study revealed that HBM factors: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, cues to action, and perceived self-efficacy are significant predictors of mothers’ intention to utilize the ITNs when acting together. Belief in personal threat significantly predicts mothers’ intention to utilize the ITNs over and above the belief in the effectiveness of health behavior. In addition, the study found that the belief in the effectiveness health behavior significantly predict mothers’ to utilize the ITNs. It was therefore recommended that government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) should stimulate the promotion and sensitization of people through family members, radio/television that intention every individual in all endemic countries are vulnerable, followed with complications and possible negative consequences and perhaps death

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Malaria disease is one of the leading contributors to deaths around the globe. While a significant success has been recorded with 12.7 million deaths ward off since 2000; recent estimates revealed evidence of existing threat with an estimated 263 million cases and 597,000 mortality globally, with an incidence of 60.4 cases per 1000 population at risk. A shift from 58.6 cases per 1000 of population at risk over the previous year (World Health Organisation [WHO], 2024) indicating that the global malaria burden remains high and unequally distributed. Sadly, WHO African region bears the greatest burden of the disease with nearly 94% and 95% of the cases and mortality respectively (WHO, 2024). Malaria disease takes its toll on the world poorest nations while infants and young children under five remains the worst hit of malaria-related mortality (WHO, 2024). Paradoxically, within the sub-Saharan African nations, Nigeria accounted for 27% malaria disease and 31% deaths (UNICEF, 2024). While there is global reduction in deaths rate since 2015; the incidence rate soars by 5% (WHO, 2024). Although, some countries such as Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Timor-Leste, Cabo Verde, Beliz and Egypt have been certified malaria free following at least three, four and six consecutive years of zero indigenous cases respectively. Nigeria still remains among the four African countries with unacceptably high cases of malaria (WHO, 2024). For instance, each year, 30 million women in malaria prone areas turn out to be pregnant and as a result malaria constitutes threats to mothers and their babies’ resulting in about 200000 neonate deaths (WHO, 2023).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Malaria is a mosquito-borne infectious disease caused by protozoan parasites belonging to the genus Plasmodium. Malaria transmission happens when an infected female mosquito bites an uninfected person (Ajegena & Oti, 2020). Among the five species which accounted for nearly all human malaria infections; Plasmodium falciparum has been acknowledged as the most severe and deadly of all human malaria parasites (Kotepui, et al., 2020). The main malaria preventive strategies include the use of intermittent preventative treatment with anti-malaria medications, environmental hygiene as well as the correct and timely use of ITNs (Hopkins, 2015) and use of vaccine which has not been implemented in Nigeria Shekarau et al. (2024). In view of these, World Health Organization and Roll Back Malaria (RBM) partners now recommend that distribution of ITNs should be made free to mothers as well as members of endemic countries at subsidized rate. Ensuring greater equity of usage and coverage led to the use of varieties of distribution systems to achieve universal access, these include: targeted campaigns at town-square, religious centers, maternity wards and health centres to deliver nets to most-at-risk populations, which include mothers and children within five years. The investment into this simple yet effective intervention has been substantial. For instance, despite the distribution of ITNs to the targeted populations across Nigeria with about 73% coverage of the population at-risk in the year 2014/2015, malaria cases among mothers is still on the increase across Africa continent and Nigeria in particular (WHO, 2015). It is based on the above background that this study examined the HBM as a predictor of mothers’ intention to utilize ITNs.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Statement of the Problem</h4>
    <p>
      One of the greatest challenges in the control of malaria is having health workers in motivating mothers towards preventing mosquito bites by using insecticides mosquito nets, insect repellents, indoor residual spraying (IRS) and draining of stagnant water around their houses. As a result, the health workers were encouraged by World Health Organisation and other stakeholders to distribute free ITNs to mothers during the pre-natal and post-natal services. Consequently, at mothers–health workers’ meetings, emphases were placed on regular and appropriate use of ITNs.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      In fact, while massive funding is channeled into campaigns to eliminate poliovirus, tuberculosis, Ebola disease, terrorism, Lassa-fever as well as to prevent the spread of Human Immuno Deficiency Virus (HIV), Malaria disease could be eliminated through mothers’ strict adherence to the use of Insecticides Treated Nets and other preventive practices. Its elimination will prove that people can be persuaded to change their behaviours through innovations in health education and preventive practices, which revolve around the health action of the population at risk.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Research efforts have captured the history, pathology and impacts of Malaria on endemic countries particularly Nigeria, but there are dearth of pointer to the implication of Health Belief Model as a predictor of mothers’ Intention to Utilise Insecticide Treated Nets. It is in a bid to bridge this gap the present study examines the Health Belief Model as a predictor of mothers’ intention to utilize ITNs.

    <h3>Review of Literature</h3>
    <h4>Health Belief Model and malaria prevention</h4>
    <p>
      The Health Belief Model (HBM) was developed in the early 1950s by social psychologists Irwin Rosenstock, Godfrey Hochbaum, Stephen Kegeles and Howard Leventhal at the US Public Health Service to enhance the understanding of the widespread failure of screening programs for tuberculosis and prevention strategies for the early detection of diseases (Bliss et al, 2015). The utility of health belief model has been noted in the prediction of wide range of health-related behaviors such as being screened for the early detection of asymptomatic diseases and receiving immunizations. Davis (2013) remarked that this model has been applied to understand patients' responses to symptoms of disease, compliance with medical regimens, lifestyle behaviors for instance, malaria risk behaviors) and behaviors related to chronic illnesses, which may require long-term behavior maintenance in addition to initial behavior change. Etter (2013) posits that an individual’s likelihood of engaging in a health-related behavior is determined by the person perception of the four variables: Perceived Susceptibility; Perceived Severity; Perceived Benefit; Perceived Barrier. Each of these constructs, individually or in combination, has been used to explain health behavior. Marty (2015) pointed out that these four constructs have been broadly categorized into two main aspects of individuals’ representations of health and health behaviors: Perceived threat and Behavioral Evaluation. Amendments to the model were made in 1996 and 1988 respectively leading to the incorporation of cue to actions which represents a trigger for health behavior when appropriate beliefs are held and self-efficacy (Green et al., 2020).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The first four constructs were developed as the original tenets of the HBM. While the last two were added as research about the HBM evolved.
      The HBM is a health-specific model, which suggests that health behaviors are a result of a set of core beliefs and it has been used to predict many health behaviors (Carol et al, 2015). They further explained that the original model focus on threat perception which depends on perception of susceptibility to the illness (my chances of getting malaria are high), severity of the illness (malaria is a serious disease), behavioral evaluation which consists of barriers to performing the behavior (ITNs can be stressful to hang) and the benefits of carrying out the behavior (ITNs may help me to avoid mosquito bite), while cues to action (symptoms, family/friends prompted me to judiciously hang ITNs) and the general component which Bandura (2012) noted as the behavioral intention (self-efficacy) should be included in the model. According to Carol et al, (2015) the HBM suggests that the core beliefs should be used to predict the likelihood that behavior will occur but recently, it has been suggested that intention (self-efficacy) should be included as a mediator between beliefs and health behavior.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Perceived susceptibility entails individual’s belief about their personal risk of contracting a disease. Prinsloo (2015) noted that the higher the perceived risk, the higher the odds of an individual engaging in behaviors that decrease the risk. According to Prinsloo (2015), individuals vary widely in their perception of susceptibility to ill health condition or disease Perceived susceptibility has been found to be predictive of a number of health-promotion behaviors including smoking sensation, breast self-examination, healthy dental behaviors, appropriate use of mosquito treated net and healthy diet and exercise (Powell, 2014). Other study such as Mitiku and Assefa (2017) noted that caregivers who perceived that their child could be susceptible to feverish condition were more likely to seek treatment as in contrast to caregivers who lowly perceive their susceptibility to the health problem such as malaria. Similar study observed that children of parents who had knowledge of the presence of abundant mosquito in their homes were more likely to reliably use of bed nets (Akello et al., 2022).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Perceived Severity denotes the subjective assessment of the seriousness of a health problem (such as malaria) and its potential consequences (Rosenstock, et al. 1997; Green et al., 2020). An individual with perceived severity about an illness such as malaria within related risk factors and complications will tend to engage a body–mind relationship to adopt preventive measures such as the use of long lasting insecticide nets (LLITNs) that suit his belief and experiences. A recent study in Nigeria showed that being caregivers who had felt pain of suffering malaria within the past 12 months were predictive of vaccine awareness.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Perceived benefits describe an individual’s belief in the effectiveness of a recommended action to reduce risk or seriousness. People are more likely to adopt health intervention if they believe in the potency of the health intervention program. For instance, females and male caretakers of children who perceived the benefits of bed nets in safeguarding against mosquito ensure their use (Beer et al., 2012). Moreover, the knowledge that sleeping under insecticide treated nets offers protection against malaria and not holding fallacy about malaria prevention was significant predictor of ITNs use among pregnant women (Ankoma et al., 2012).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The perceived barriers are the perceived impediments that deter the adoption of a health behavior. These include discomfort associated with heat, absence of space, fear of the chemical, challenges of hanging net, cost, misconceptions among others (Ajegena & Oti, 2020). In addition, a qualitative study, in Northwest Ethiopia noted that nearly all barriers associated with utilization of insecticide treated nets were linked with misconceptions and wrong perceptions of malaria and ITN consequently, respondents with high degree of perceived barriers were 475 less likely to make use of ITN (Yirsaw et al., 2021).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Cues to action represent external or internal triggers that motivate people to adopt health behaviors. These cues to action may include external cues such as a mass media campaign, social influence, or internal cues such as a negative change in bodily state or perception of symptoms (WHO, 2015). Acosta et al. (2019) asserted that from behavioral viewpoint, access to ITNs can be enhanced through encouraging families to register in the course of mass campaigns among others.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Self-efficacy refers to one’s confidence in their ability to perform a behavior successfully. High self-efficacy is crucial for long-term health behavior adherence. For instance, higher self-efficacy was related to the tendency of consistently using ITNs (Kakaire & Christofides, 2023).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Furthermore socioeconomic and demographic variable such as wealth status, religion, type of community and numbers of children were predictors ITN use (Barrow et al., 2025). Similarly, Adjoh, et al. (2023) found location of residence, mothers age, educational attainment affluence, religion, size of the family and prior experience of child’s deaths were linked the use of ITNs. The role of mother education in the prevention of malaria is paramount. Mothers with higher level education had twice higher odd of presenting her child for antimalarial treatment in contrast to uneducated. (Cerderlund, 2020). Ma et al. (2017) in a study found that higher maternal education attainment was positively related with lowered prevalence of malaria.

    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>
      The survey research design was adopted for this study. The population of this study included mothers who attend prenatal and post natal Care centres in the 424 registered health centers in Edo State. Effort, to obtain the exact number of attendees on yearly bases was not successful as at the time the researchers visited to the State Ministry of health. However, the number of attendees in the various centres visited ranged from 100 to 200 bearing in mind that attendees’ record is replete with repetition.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The sample for the study was 180 participants selected through multi-stage sampling technique. In the first stage, the researchers apply purposive sampling in the selection of selected the three most populated Local Government Areas (LGAs) (Oredo, Egor, Ikpoba-Okha) in Edo South senatorial district, followed by the two most populated LGAs (Akoko–Edo and Etsako-West) in Edo North senatorial district and the most populated LGA (Esan-West) in Edo Central senatorial district. Secondly, the purposive sampling procedure was also adopted in selecting one (1) of the largest comprehensive health centre from each local government area. Thus, a total of six (6) comprehensive health centres were used.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Thirdly, 30 respondents were randomly selected from each comprehensive health centre. Consequently, 180 participants were selected for the study in the following order 90 from Edo South, 30 from Edo Central and 60 from Edo North Senatorial district. The instrument used for the study was a questionnaire developed by the researcher after a careful study of the related literature. The questionnaire consists of two sections. Section A tested for bio-demographic data. While Section B was a structured questionnaire with 28 items, which elicited information on the Health Belief Model related factors in mothers’ intention to utilize Long-Lasting Insecticide Nets. Responses were sought using a modified Likert Scale format of strongly Agree, Agree, Disagree and Strongly Disagree. The instrument was content validated by three professionals in the field of health management and health education.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The reliability of the instrument was ascertained on 20 respondents. The data obtained was analyzed with Pearson product moment correlation co-efficient and correlation co-efficient of 0.85 was obtained hence considered reliable for the study. The instrument was administered by the researchers with the aid of ten research assistants. Data collected were analyzed with hierarchical regression. The responses were coded, such that for strongly Agree = 4, Agree = 3, Disagree = 2 and Strongly Disagree = 1, negatively worded items were scored in reverse order. Strongly Agree and Agree were treated as favourable views, while Disagree and Strongly Disagree were treated as unfavourable view. The favourable view was awarded 2 points, while unfavourable view was awarded 1 point. The deciding rule was based on a specific score (50 or benchmark) set by the researchers. Therefore, the scores that fell below this benchmark were the impediments of mothers’ intention to utilise ITNs, while those who scored above the benchmark were the factors promoting mothers intention to utilise ITNs for the prevention of malaria disease.

    <p>
      The results in table 1 showed a p-value for HBM Model: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, Cues to action, and self-efficacy are far less than the alpha level of 0.05. Therefore the null hypothesis is rejected. This implies the HBM Model is a good predictor of mothers’ intention to utilise the ITNs. In addition, each of the variable contributed to the significantly to the mothers’ intention to utilise the ITNs.

      The results in table 2 shows that the belief in personal threat variables: perceived susceptibility has an standard Beta value of 0.059, p-value of 0.0315, perceived severity has a standardised value of -0.210, p-value of 0.0064, perceived benefit has a standardised value of 0.200, p-value of 0.0001. The obtained p-values are less than 0.05. This implies that belief in personal threat does significantly predict mothers’ intention to utilise the ITNs over and above the belief in the effectiveness of health behaviour.

      Table 3 shows the model summary and change statistics for a hierarchical multiple regression analysis conducted in two steps. In in the model 1, the first predictor, the belief in personal threat entered explained 41.2% of the variance in mothers intention to utilise ITNs (R² = .412, Adjusted R² = .392). This model yielded a statistically significant improvement in prediction F(4, 271) = 16.477, p {'<'} .001), indicating that the initial set of predictors made a meaningful contribution to explaining the outcome variable.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      In Model 2, the belief in the effectiveness of health behaviour was entered into the model, resulting in an increase in the explained variance to 52.3 % (R² = .523, Adjusted R² = .501). The change in R² (ΔR² = .110) was also statistically significant (F Change (2, 245) = 18.490, p {'<'} .001), signifying that the inclusion of the new predictors bring about a significant improvement in the model's explanatory power.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Largely, the results suggest that the introduction of the predictors in both steps of the hierarchical regression contributed meaningfully to the prediction of the dependent variable (mothers intention to use ITNs), with Model 2 contributing a more robust and statistically significant model fit than Model 1, as demonstrated by the reduced standard error of the estimate (from 2.3650 to 2.1439).

      Furthermore the data in table 5 revealed that R increased slowly downwards as more regression was done. As the second predictor variable the belief in the effectiveness of was added, the R value had reached 0.796 representing an increase of 0.216 which implies that the joint contribution of both belief in personal threat and belief in the effectiveness of health behaviour to the variation in mother intention to utilise ITNs is about 61.2%. The adjusted R2 value of 0.501 implies both belief in personal threat and belief in the effectiveness of health behaviour are fairly good predictors of mother intention to utilise ITNs. The R2 change value showed that belief in the effectiveness of health behaviour accounted for. It further showed that belief in the effectiveness of health behaviour contributed (0.336) accounting for about 33% of the total variation in mothers intention to utilise ITNS.

    <br />

    <h3>Discussion of Findings</h3>
    <p>
      This study revealed that the Health Belief Model (HBM) constructs comprising perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, cues to action, and perceived self-efficacy are significant predictors of mothers’ intention to utilize insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) when considered collectively. This finding implies that these constructs are indispensable in bringing about meaningful and positive behavioral change regarding ITN use.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      These results align with Mitiku and Assefa (2017), who observed that caregivers who perceived their children as susceptible to feverish conditions were more likely to seek treatment than those with a lower perception of susceptibility to malaria. Similarly, Akello et al. (2022) found that children whose parents were aware of a high mosquito presence in their homes were more likely to consistently use bed nets. This reinforces the notion that the perception of health threats is central to promoting healthier behaviors (Bandura, 2012; Prinsloo, 2015).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Moreover, the study demonstrated that belief in personal threat as measured through perceived susceptibility, severity, and benefits significantly predicts mothers’ intention to use ITNs, accounting for 41% of the total variation. This supports the findings of Albert (2012) and Prinsloo (2015), who asserted that perceived threat is a primary driver in adopting health-promoting behaviors. Similar trends were observed by Powell (2014), who found that perceived susceptibility predicted a range of health behaviors, including smoking cessation, breast self-examination, dental hygiene, appropriate use of mosquito-treated nets, and healthy diet and exercise. Likewise, Ankoma et al. (2012) reported that adequate information about the protective benefits of ITNs and the rejection of malaria-related misconceptions significantly predicted ITN use among pregnant women.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Furthermore, the study established that belief in the effectiveness of health behavior—particularly cues to action and perceived self-efficacy—significantly influences mothers’ intention to utilize ITNs. This suggests that the likelihood of ITN use increases when mothers are exposed to motivating triggers and possess confidence in their ability to act. For instance, Kakaire and Christofides (2023) found that higher self-efficacy was associated with consistent ITN use.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      The findings of this study indicate that the Health Belief Model is an effective framework for predicting mothers’ intention to utilize insecticide-treated nets. Specifically, the perception of malaria as a personal threat and the belief in the efficacy of preventive behaviors were strong predictors of ITN utilization.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Therefore, efforts should be made to help mothers recognize the value of ITNs in malaria control and to identify and address the barriers hindering their use. Promoting awareness through peer influence, community engagement, and mass media can enhance mothers’ intention to use ITNs. In light of these findings, individuals should recognize that all Nigerians are vulnerable to malaria and its consequences. Hence, equal attention should be given to perceived susceptibility and severity as critical components in the fight against malaria.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Recommendations</h3>
    <p>In view of the findings, the following were recommended:</p>
    <div style={{ marginLeft: '20px', marginBottom: '20px' }}>
      <p>1. Government and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) should stimulate the promotion and sensitization of people through family members, radio/television that every individual in all endemic countries are vulnerable, followed with complications and possible negative consequences and perhaps death.</p>
      <p>2. Future campaigns should include more purposeful, social and health education on the importance of subjective opinion of the values of enacting health behaviors promoting the regular use of ITNs in the control of malaria.</p>
