    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p className="abstract">
      Obesity has become a major public health issue in Ghana, associated with various metabolic disorders and a decrease in quality of life. Despite numerous efforts to reduce the prevalence of obesity in Ghana, the rate of obesity has continued to increase, particularly among children and adults. This research focused on evaluating the impact of an eight-week aerobic exercise on obesity indices of adults residing in the Ayawaso West Municipal and Accra Metropolis of Ghana. Forty obese adults aged 18 - 35 years participated in this study voluntarily. The aerobic exercise programme consisted of three sessions per week, each lasting 60 minutes. The participants’ body weight, body fat percentage, body mass index (BMI) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) were assessed before and after the completion of the eight-week aerobic exercise programme. After the eight-week aerobic exercise programme, significant differences were found in the participants’ body weight, body fat percentage, body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio, (p{'<'}0.05). The findings revealed that engaging in the aerobic exercise programme led to significant decreases in body weight, body fat percentage, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio among obese adults. It is recommended that Ghana Ministry of Health should prioritise the integration of aerobic exercise programmes into public health initiatives to combat obesity and related health issues. Community-based exercise programmes can effectively promote physical activity and improve health outcomes among adults.

    <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Obesity, defined as the excessive accumulation of body fat that poses a health risk, has emerged as a leading public health concern globally. More than 1.9 billion adults were overweight in 2022, with over 650 million categorized as obese (BMI ≥ 30 kg/m²) globally [1]. Moreover, obesity contributes significantly to the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs), including type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, osteoarthritis, and several cancers, while also increasing the risk of premature mortality and reducing quality of life [1,2]. It impairs physical, psychological, and social functioning, limits mobility, and has been identified as a key risk factor for disability. These outcomes place a substantial strain on national health systems, especially in developing countries where resources are already limited [1-3].
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Africa is undergoing a nutrition and lifestyle transition, which has been accompanied by a sharp rise in overweight and obesity, especially in urban areas [4,5]. Rapid urbanization, reduced physical activity, increased sedentary occupations, and the proliferation of calorie-dense processed foods are accelerating this trend [6,7]. Although some intervention studies exploring effective measures to reduce obesity have been conducted in adolescents or through school-based programs [8-10], there is a noticeable gap in evidence-based community interventions targeting adult obesity through sustainable approaches such as structured physical activity. Particularly, few studies have examined how aerobic exercise, an accessible and cost-effective method, affects key obesity indices such as body weight, body fat percentage, and waist-to-hip ratio in African urban settings [11-12].
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      In Ghana, obesity is emerging as a pressing health challenge, especially in urban centers like Accra and the Ayawaso West Municipality. The 2022 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS) reported that about 50% women in Ghana aged 20-49 are overweight or obese (22% obesity and 28.2% overweight) while about 20.7% of males are overweight or obese - 3.9% obesity and 16.8% overweight as the Greater Accra region has the highest prevalence of overweight or obesity among adults aged 20-49 years recording 61.3% of overweight or obesity [13]. The rise in obesity has been linked to reduced physical activity participation, poor dietary habits, high consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, and reliance on motorized transport [14–16]. Additionally, public misconceptions about weight loss strategies, such as the overuse of slimming teas, diet pills, and fat-burning supplements persist despite limited evidence supporting their long-term effectiveness or safety [17]. Studies have explored correlates of obesity in the Ghanaian context. For instance, [18] emphasized the role of the built environment in shaping physical activity behaviors in Accra, while [19] studied workplace physical inactivity and its link to obesity among bank workers. However, most of these studies are observational and do not assess the effectiveness of interventions. A few intervention-based studies, like those by [20], have examined school-based physical activity programs for adolescents, but there remains a lack of controlled experimental studies evaluating structured aerobic exercise programs for adults in urban Ghana. Moreover, no known study to date has examined this relationship specifically within the Ayawaso West and Accra Metropolitan districts, which are key urban zones with high sedentary workforces and limited access to recreational infrastructure [13].
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Aerobic exercise, defined as rhythmic, continuous movement of large muscle groups sustained over time improve cardiovascular fitness, reduce body fat, and enhance metabolic function [21]. Unlike anaerobic activity, aerobic training is better suited for sustained energy expenditure and fat oxidation [22]. When performed consistently, moderate-intensity aerobic exercises such as brisk walking and step aerobics can lead to significant improvements in body composition, including reductions in BMI, body fat percentage, and waist circumference [21]. However, the extent of these benefits in Ghanaian urban adults remains underexplored. Therefore, this study was designed to evaluate the effect of an eight-week aerobic exercise program on four key obesity indices: body weight, body mass index, body fat percentage, and waist-to-hip ratio among adults in the Ayawaso West Municipal and Accra Metropolitan Districts. The study hypothesized that there will be no significant differences in the four obesity indices of body weight, body mass index, body fat percentage and waist-to-hip ratio after eight-week aerobic exercise. The findings are intended to contribute to the growing body of local evidence on community-level physical activity interventions and to inform public health strategies aimed at mitigating obesity in urban Ghana.

    <h3>2. Materials and Methods</h3>
    <h4>2.1 Study Design</h4>
    <p>
      This study utilized a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest research design to investigate the physiological effects of an eight-week aerobic exercise intervention on obesity indices among adults in Accra Metropolis and Ayawaso West Municipality. This design was deemed appropriate for evaluating intervention outcomes in naturalistic, community-based settings where randomized controlled trials may be logistically challenging or ethically constrained [23]. By comparing baseline measurements with post-intervention measurements, any changes in variables such as body weight, body fat percentage, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio can be attributed to the effects of aerobic exercise program [24]. The choice of this design is particularly suited to public health research that seeks to evaluate behavioural interventions in real-world contexts while maintaining a reasonable level of internal validity. Although the absence of a control group limits the ability to rule out all potential confounding variables, the within-participant comparison strengthens the causal inference regarding the intervention’s impact [23]. Furthermore, the pretest-post-test format enables the quantification of effect sizes over time, making it possible to assess the degree of physiological change associated with the exercise regimen [25].
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>2.2 Study Population</h4>
    <p>
      The study population consisted of all young adult participants who were newly registered for aerobic sessions at Pulse Fitness Center and Fitness 1 Gym within the Greater Accra Region of Ghana. The registration was done in May 2024, and the exercise spanned from June 2024 to July 2024. These individuals were engaged in aerobic exercise programs after their recruitment within Pulse Fitness Center and Fitness 1 Gym, which were supervised by the principal investigator for proper exercise prescription. The participants voluntarily enrolled in fitness sessions during the specified study period. The population was 63 individuals who registered for exercise within the designated timeframe for aerobic sessions at both fitness centers during the study period.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>2.3.1 Inclusion Criteria</h4>
    <p>
      The study specifically included adults aged between 18 and 35 years. This age range was selected because young adults typically exhibit higher adaptability to lifestyle interventions such as aerobic exercise and are more likely to demonstrate measurable physiological changes within a relatively short intervention period. Additionally, focusing on this age group helps to minimize confounding variables related to age-associated metabolic decline and chronic health conditions that are more prevalent in older population, who have been classified as obese based on BMI ≥ 30 kg/m².
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>2.3.2 Exclusion Criteria</h4>
    <p>
      The study excluded individuals with medical contraindications to aerobic exercise, such as uncontrolled hypertension, cardiovascular disease, or any condition posing significant health risks during physical activity. Pregnant women with complications were also excluded, as their exercise needs require specialized supervision. Additionally, individuals with musculoskeletal conditions or injuries that could limit safe participation in aerobic exercise were excluded to maintain the consistency and integrity of the intervention.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>2.4.1 Sample Size Determination</h4>
    <p>
      The sample size for this study was determined using simple random sampling from the total population of individuals newly registered for aerobic sessions at Pulse Fitness Centre and Fitness 1 Gym within the Ayawaso West Municipal and Accra Metropolis. The decision to use simple random sampling was based on its ability to minimize selection bias and ensure that each individual in the target population had an equal chance of being selected, thereby enhancing the representativeness and generalizability of the findings.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      A total of 40 participants were recruited, consisting of an equal distribution of 20 males and 20 females. This balanced recruitment approach was adopted to account for potential gender-related variations in response to aerobic exercise, ensuring that the results would not be skewed by sex-based physiological differences.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      The sample size was determined based on previous literature and similar intervention studies that effectively demonstrated significant changes in physiological parameters with comparable group sizes. Additionally, practical considerations such as time constraints, available resources, and participant accessibility influenced the final sample size. The sampling frame consisted of a complete list of eligible individuals from both fitness centers who met the inclusion criteria.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>2.4.2 Data Collection Procedures</h4>
    <p>
      Participants underwent baseline assessments of body weight, body fat percentage, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio before starting the eight-week aerobic exercise program. Baseline assessments of body weight, body fat percentage, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio were conducted before the commencement of the eight-week aerobic exercise program. This was essential to establish each participant's initial physiological status, which served as a reference point for evaluating changes attributable to the intervention. Collecting baseline data allowed for accurate measurement of the effectiveness of the aerobic exercise program by providing a point of comparison for post-intervention outcomes. The aerobic exercise program was structured to include three sessions per week, each lasting 60 minutes. This frequency and duration were selected based on established exercise guidelines from the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM), which recommend that adults engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise per week to achieve meaningful health benefits, including weight management and cardiovascular improvement [26]. Data on participants' body weight, body fat percentage, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio were collected at the end of the eight-week intervention period.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>2.4.3 Measurement Protocol</h4>
    <p><strong>Body weight:</strong></p>
    <p>
      <strong>Equipment required:</strong> Digital glass weighing scale, recording sheets<br />
      A calibrated digital glass weighing scale (HN-289; Omron, Kyoto, Japan) was used to measure participants' body weight. This specific scale was selected due to its high measurement accuracy with a precision of ±0.1 kg, user-friendly design, and proven reliability in both clinical and fitness settings. The Omron HN-289 has been validated in previous studies and is widely recognized for its consistency and ease of calibration [27–28]. The recording sheet used for data collection included essential participant details and key variables relevant to the study. Each sheet captured the participant’s identification number to ensure confidentiality, along with demographic information such as age and sex. Physiological variables recorded included body weight, body fat percentage, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, hip circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      <strong>Procedure:</strong> The digital glass weighing scale was set up on a flat, hard surface to ensure measurement accuracy, as uneven or soft surfaces can cause the scale to provide incorrect readings due to instability or improper weight distribution [29]. Participants were instructed to remove shoes and heavy clothing before stepping onto the scale to prevent external factors from artificially inflating their body weight measurements. They stood still on the scale with their feet positioned evenly and arms relaxed at their sides to ensure proper weight balance and to avoid shifting that could distort the reading. The scale was read and recorded to the nearest tenth of a kilogram (kg) once it stabilized, ensuring a precise and reliable measurement of body weight.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p><strong>Body mass index (BMI):</strong></p>
    <p>
      <strong>Equipment required:</strong> Seca stadiometer, BMI formula.<br />
      A Seca stadiometer (Seca 213, Seca GmbH & Co. KG, Hamburg, Germany) was used to measure participants' standing height. The stadiometer was assembled and positioned on a flat, stable surface against a vertical wall to ensure accuracy, as placing it on an uneven surface or near an inclined wall could compromise measurement precision [30].
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      <strong>Procedure:</strong> Participants were instructed to remove their shoes, headwear, and any hair accessories that could interfere with accurate measurement. Each participant stood upright with their heels together, legs straight, arms at their sides, shoulders relaxed, and head positioned in the Frankfurt plane (a standard anatomical position where the lower orbital margin is aligned with the upper margin of the ear canal) to maintain consistency and ensure the correct posture [31]. The headpiece of the stadiometer was gently lowered to rest firmly on the crown of the participant’s head without compressing the hair. Measurements were read at eye level and recorded in meters (m) once the participant was properly positioned and stationary.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p><strong>Body fat percentage</strong></p>
    <p>
      <strong>Equipment required:</strong> Omron hand-to-foot bioimpedance analyzer (BIA) device, recording sheets<br />
      Body fat percentage was measured using an Omron hand-to-foot bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) device (Omron BF511, Kyoto, Japan). This device was selected due to its multi-frequency technology and high validity in estimating body composition, as supported by previous researches [32–32]. Compared to single-frequency BIA devices, the Omron BF511 provides more accurate assessments of total body fat by using both hand and foot electrodes, which offer a more comprehensive impedance pathway through the body.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      <strong>Procedure:</strong> The device was set up according to the manufacturer's guidelines, and measurements were taken with participants barefoot and standing upright on the device’s footplates while holding the hand electrodes with arms extended forward at a 90-degree angle. This positioning ensures proper conduction of the electrical signal throughout the entire body. Participants were instructed to avoid food, vigorous exercise, and caffeine intake for at least 2-4 hours prior to measurement to minimize fluctuations in hydration levels that could affect the accuracy of the readings [34]. Body fat percentage readings were recorded immediately on standardized recording sheets designed to capture all relevant participant information and measurement outcomes.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p><strong>Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR):</strong></p>
    <p>
      <strong>Equipment required:</strong> Seca measuring tape, recording sheets.<br />
      Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was measured using a non-elastic Seca measuring tape (Seca 201, Hamburg, Germany), known for its high measurement precision, ease of handling, and durability. The measurements were recorded on standardized recording sheets specifically designed to capture waist and hip circumferences accurately and systematically for each participant. The Seca measuring tape was selected due to its automatic retraction mechanism and smooth gliding tape, which allows for consistent tension and minimizes measurement errors compared to flexible, elastic, or uncalibrated tapes. Proper tension and positioning are critical for reliable circumference measurements and reproducibility across sessions.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      <strong>Procedure:</strong> Participants were instructed to stand in the anatomical position upright with feet slightly apart, arms relaxed at their sides, and palms facing forward during waist and hip circumference measurements. This posture was essential to ensure standardization, proper body alignment, and muscle relaxation, which help minimize variability and measurement errors. Maintaining the anatomical position ensures that body contours are consistently exposed and measured in the same way across all participants, improving the accuracy and reliability of waist-to-hip ratio assessments [35]. Using a seca measuring tape, the circumference of the waist was measured at the midline between the lower margin of the last palpable ribs and the top of the iliac crest. The circumference of the hips was then measured at the widest part of the buttocks [35]. The measurements were recorded to the nearest centimeter (cm). The waist-to-hip ratio was calculated by dividing the waist circumference by the hip circumference. A WHR value above 0.95 for men and 0.80 for women indicated central obesity and an increased risk of health problems [36].
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>2.4.4 Data Analysis</h4>
    <p>
      Data was analyzed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 26. The data was exported into Excel for cleaning and analysis, during which all invalid data points were removed. Missing values were handled using listwise deletion, where any case with missing data for key variables was excluded from the final analysis. Both descriptive and inferential statistics were employed to analyze the data. The Descriptive statistics, including means and standard deviations, were used to summarize continuous variables such as body weight, body fat percentage, BMI, waist circumference, hip circumference, and waist-to-hip ratio, both at baseline and after the intervention. Percentages and frequencies were used to describe categorical variables such as sex and age group distributions, whiles inferential statistics, specifically the paired t-test, were employed to assess whether there were statistically significant differences between pre-intervention and post-intervention measurements for body weight, body fat percentage, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratio. This test was appropriate because it compares the means of the same group measured at two different time points (before and after the eight-week aerobic exercise program), allowing the study to determine whether the observed changes were statistically significant. In all analyses, a p-value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant for the study.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>2.4.5 Ethical Considerations</h4>
    <p>
      Ethical clearance to conduct this study was sought from the University of Health and Allied Sciences Research Ethics Committee with protocol identification number UHAS-REC A.8 [32] 23-24. Ensuring anonymity and confidentiality through the assignment of codes to maintain the privacy of participant information. Consent forms were issued to participants, informing them of their voluntary participation and their right to withdraw from the study at any time, and participants were made aware that their identifiable data, such as names or contact addresses, would be kept confidential and would not be used for any other purpose beyond the research. Data obtained from the study was treated as confidential and used only for the purpose of the study. The completed forms were kept securely and anonymously. In all cases the principal investigator ensured that data produced from the study was coded, stored, and locked at the Department of Sports and Exercise Medical Sciences of the University of Health and Allied Sciences, and access is restricted to authorized personnel only.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>3. Results</h3>
    <h4>3.1 Demographics</h4>
    <p>
      The study sample 40 participants. The majority (42.5%) of the participants were aged 31-35 years, followed by those aged 26-30 (27.5%) and 21-25 (20.0%), reflecting individuals who are in transitional life stages. The gender distribution is perfectly balanced, with 50% male and 50% female respondents. This equal representation is crucial for ensuring that the findings of any research conducted on this population can be generalized across genders. When examining marital status, the data reveals that a significant portion of the respondents are either single (45.0%) or married (50.0%), with only 5.0% identifying as divorced. This shows that the majority of the sample consists of individuals in stable marital situations, which influence their perspectives and experiences in various contexts, including social, economic, and psychological dimensions. The occupational status of the respondents shows that 45.0% are formally employed, while 20.0% are informally employed. Additionally, 22.5% of the respondents are unemployed. The high percentage of formally employed individuals indicates a level of economic stability within the sample, while the notable presence of unemployed respondents suggests that there are varying levels of economic engagement.

      The data presented in Table 2 provides an overview of the weight measurements of participants, the mean weight of the participants during the pretest is 98.830±8.11 kg while that of the weight during the posttest is 92.98±7.78 kg. The minimum and maximum weights recorded by the female participants during the pretest are 85.00 kg and 117.00 kg, respectively, whereas the posttest minimum and maximum weight scores are 79.00 kg and 111.00 kg, respectively.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      The observed mean weight reduction of 5.85 kg, without considering statistical significance, suggests that the eight-week aerobic program was effective in promoting weight loss among the female participants. This positive outcome is evidenced by the lower posttest mean weight and the narrower range of individual weights compared to the pretest.

      To test the hypothesis that there will be no significant difference in weight from pretest to posttest, a paired t-test was conducted. The results presented in Table 3 provide the weight changes observed in participants following an eight-week aerobic program. The pretest mean weight of the participants was 98.83 kg, while the posttest mean weight decreased to 92.98 kg. This indicates a mean difference of 5.85 kg, suggesting that participants experienced significant weight loss as a result of the intervention.

    <br />

    <p>
      The calculated t-value of 37.93 is substantially higher than the critical t-value of ±2.022. This large t-value indicates a strong difference between the pretest and posttest means, suggesting that the observed weight loss is highly unlikely to have occurred by chance. With 39 degrees of freedom and a significance level of P {'<'} 0.05, the results are statistically significant, leading to the conclusion that the null hypothesis should be rejected.

    <h4>3.3 The body fat percentage of participants after 8 weeks of exercise</h4>
    <p>
      The descriptive statistics table 4 provides insights into the changes in body fat percentage of participants following an eight-week aerobic program. During the pretest, the mean body fat percentage was 33.63±5.14%, indicating that participants had a relatively high level of body fat. The body fat percentages ranged from a minimum of 25.00% to a maximum of 43.00%, with a standard deviation of 5.14% reflecting considerable variability among individual scores.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      After the completion of the program, the mean body fat percentage decreased to 31.65±4.78%. This reduction of 1.98% suggests that the aerobic program was effective in lowering body fat among participants. The posttest body fat percentages ranged from 24.00% to 41.00%, with a standard deviation of 4.78%, indicating a shift toward healthier body fat levels and a slightly more consistent distribution among participants.

    <h4>3.4 The body mass index (BMI) of participants after 8 weeks of exercise</h4>
    <p>
      The descriptive statistics table (Table 6: Body Mass Index (BMI) of participants) reveals important changes in the Body Mass Index (BMI) of participants following an eight-week aerobic program. The mean BMI and standard deviation during the pretest were 33.63±5.14 kg/m², indicating that participants were generally classified as obese. The BMI values ranged from a minimum of 30.06 kg/m² to a maximum of 38.06 kg/m², with a standard deviation of 5.14 kg/m² reflecting a wide variability in individual BMI scores.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      After completing the program, the mean BMI and standard deviation decreased to 31.65±4.78 kg/m², representing a reduction of 1.98 kg/m². The posttest BMI ranged from 28.34 kg/m² to 35.29 kg/m², with a standard deviation of 4.78 kg/m², indicating a shift toward healthier BMI values and a slightly more consistent distribution among participants. The findings demonstrate a positive outcome from the intervention, with a notable reduction in mean BMI and a decrease in variability among participants.

    <h4>3.5 The waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) of participants after 8 weeks of exercise</h4>
    <p>
      The descriptive statistics table 8 outlines the changes in waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) among participants after an eight-week aerobic program. In the pretest, the mean WHR and standard deviation were 0.86±0.045, indicating a relatively high ratio that may be associated with an increased risk of health issues related to body fat distribution. The WHR values ranged from a minimum of 0.76 to a maximum of 0.93, with a standard deviation of 0.045, suggesting limited variability among participants.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Following the program, the mean WHR and standard deviation decreased to 0.84±0.051, reflecting a reduction of 0.02. The posttest WHR values ranged from 0.73 to 0.92, with a standard deviation of 0.051, indicating a slight improvement in body composition and a marginal increase in variability. These results indicate a positive impact of the aerobic program, evidenced by the decrease in mean waist-to-hip ratio.

      To test the hypothesis that there will be no significant difference in waist-to-hip ratio from pretest to posttest, a paired t-test was conducted. The paired t-test results presented in Table 9 offer a comprehensive analysis of the waist-to-hip ratio changes observed in participants following an eight-week aerobic program. The pretest mean waist-to-hip ratio of the participants was 0.86, while the posttest mean waist-to-hip ratio decreased to 0.84. This indicates a mean difference of 0.019, suggesting that participants experienced a significant reduction in waist-to-hip ratio as a result of the intervention.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      The calculated t-value of 6.14 is substantially higher than the critical t-value of ±2.022. This t-value indicates a strong difference between the pretest and posttest means, suggesting that the observed reduction in waist-to-hip ratio is highly unlikely to have occurred by chance. The significance level (P {'<'} 0.05), along with 38 degrees of freedom, confirms that the results are statistically significant, leading to the conclusion that the null hypothesis can be rejected.

    <h3>4. Discussion</h3>
    <p>
      This study examined the effects of an eight-week aerobic exercise program on selected obesity indices, including body weight, body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), among adults in the Ayawaso West Municipal District and Accra Metropolis, Greater Accra Region of Ghana. The results showed significant reductions across all measured indices following the intervention. These findings suggest that structured aerobic exercise can effectively contribute to weight loss, improvements in BMI, reduction in body fat percentage, and better fat distribution, which are all essential in the management of obesity.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      The study found a significant reduction in body weight among participants after the eight-week aerobic exercise program. This reduction indicates that the intervention was effective in promoting weight loss, likely due to increased caloric expenditure and enhanced fat metabolism stimulated by regular aerobic activity. The mean weight reduction of 5.85 kg is substantial and demonstrates the potential of aerobic exercise in addressing excess body weight. These results are in line with previous studies that have shown aerobic training to be more effective than resistance training in reducing body mass and fat mass among overweight or obese individuals [20]. Similarly, a systematic review by [21] confirmed that aerobic exercise significantly improves body composition and contributes to meaningful weight loss. The consistency of these findings with the literature may be attributed to the frequency and intensity of the exercise sessions implemented in this study. Furthermore, the greater responsiveness to weight loss among some participants could be explained by their initial sedentary status or greater energy deficits during the intervention. This finding emphasizes the importance of integrating aerobic exercise into public health strategies to combat obesity in similar urban populations.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      In addition to body weight, the study also observed a significant reduction in BMI following the aerobic intervention. The decrease in BMI not only reflects weight loss but also suggests an improvement in overall body composition. This outcome is consistent with the findings of [10], who reported significant reductions in BMI and body fat percentage among overweight and obese adults participating in aerobic exercise programs. Additionally, the results are supported by a meta-analysis conducted by [9], which found that aerobic exercise effectively reduces BMI, particularly when higher intensity and longer duration sessions are maintained. The reduction in BMI observed in this study may be linked to the structured nature of the intervention and the relatively high adherence of participants throughout the eight weeks. Differences in baseline BMI levels, metabolic rates, and lifestyle factors may also explain individual variations in response to the intervention. The implication of this finding is that regular aerobic exercise can serve as an effective, non-invasive strategy for reducing BMI and mitigating the risks associated with obesity.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      A further significant finding from this study was the reduction in body fat percentage following the intervention. This result indicates a favorable shift in body composition, where fat mass was effectively reduced. This aligns with the work of [22], who found that regular aerobic exercise led to significant reductions in body fat percentage among overweight and obese adults. Similarly, [21] confirmed through a meta-analysis that aerobic exercise is an effective strategy for lowering body fat, especially when performed at moderate to high intensities over extended periods. The observed reduction in body fat percentage may have been influenced by the controlled exercise routine, which likely increased participants’ energy expenditure and improved fat oxidation. The findings also suggest that the body’s metabolic adaptations to regular aerobic exercise contributed to the reduction in stored fat. Importantly, this supports the value of aerobic exercise in targeted fat loss interventions and reinforces its role in comprehensive obesity management strategies.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      The study also demonstrated a reduction in waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) among participants after the aerobic exercise program. WHR is a key indicator of central adiposity and is closely linked to the risk of metabolic diseases. This finding is supported by [9], who emphasized that aerobic exercise can improve body composition metrics, including WHR. Reductions in WHR are especially important because they are associated with lower risks of cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and other obesity-related complications. Further support comes from [11], who reported that aerobic exercise effectively reduces both waist circumference and WHR, contributing to improved fat distribution. However, this study's findings contrast with those of [12], who reported no statistically significant changes in WHR among participants engaged in aerobic exercise, suggesting that reductions in waist and hip circumferences may have been proportionate. The discrepancy may be explained by differences in exercise intensity, participant characteristics, or adherence levels. The implication of the current study’s findings is that aerobic exercise not only promotes overall weight loss but also contributes to healthier fat distribution, which is critical in reducing central obesity and related health risks.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      In summary, the present study confirms the effectiveness of an eight-week aerobic exercise program in improving key obesity-related indices among adults in the study area. These findings provide further evidence supporting the use of aerobic exercise as a practical and effective intervention for managing obesity and improving body composition in similar populations.
    </p>
    <br />


    <h4>Limitations of the study</h4>
    <p>
      This study is not without limitations. Self-selection bias may have influenced the results, as participants who volunteered for the exercise program were likely more motivated or health-conscious than the general population, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, dietary intake was not controlled during the intervention period, potentially introducing variability, as diet plays a critical role in influencing weight loss and changes in body composition. The relatively short intervention period of eight weeks also limits the ability to assess the long-term effects and sustainability of the observed benefits. Furthermore, the study focused solely on anthropometric measurements and did not include assessments of biochemical markers or cardiorespiratory fitness, which could have provided a more comprehensive evaluation of the participants’ overall health outcomes.
    </p>
    <br />


    <h4>Recommendations</h4>
    <p>
      Public health programs should actively promote accessible aerobic exercise interventions within communities as a strategic approach to addressing the increasing prevalence of obesity. To ensure long-term success, future interventions should also incorporate strategies aimed at enhancing participant adherence and motivation, such as group-based activities and the inclusion of social support systems. Finally, future research should consider the inclusion of biochemical assessments and cardiorespiratory fitness measurements to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the health impacts of aerobic exercise interventions.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      This study has confirmed the significant impact of an eight-week aerobic exercise program on improving key body composition metrics among obese adults in the Ayawaso West Municipal District and Accra Metropolis, Greater Accra Region of Ghana. The intervention led to significant reductions in weight, BMI, body fat percentage, and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), all of which are critical indicators of obesity-related health risks. These findings align with existing literature, reinforcing the effectiveness of aerobic exercise in managing obesity and enhancing overall health outcomes.
    </p>
    <br />

    <p>
      Overall, this study highlights the importance of ongoing support and education to sustain the benefits of such aerobic exercise interventions. By fostering an environment that encourages consistent participation in aerobic activities, health outcomes can be further optimized, contributing to a healthier, more resilient population in the Ayawaso West Municipal District and Accra Metropolitan and beyond.
