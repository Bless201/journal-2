An experienced well-trained male triathlete aged 35 years completed the Western Australian Ironman triathlon in 11 h 38 min 41 s (winner's time: 8 h 3 min 56 s).

One of the revealing signs of this physical toll is the amount of muscle damage it inflicts. For example, we have shown reductions in muscle strength and jump height, together with increases in muscle soreness, blood markers of muscle damage, and inflammation in the 24 h following an Ironman triathlon (Suzuki et al., 2006). While the acute phase response has been documented, the time course of the recovery from muscle damage induced during an Ironman triathlon is less clear. Only Neubauer and colleagues (Neubauer, König, & Wagner, 2008) have outlined the recovery 1, 5, and 19 days after an Ironman race. They showed a pronounced initial systemic inflammatory response together with persistent low-grade systemic inflammation for up to 5 days after the event, reflecting incomplete recovery.

The highest value for C-reactive protein was observed 24 h after the race and for serum amyloid protein A 48 h after the race; both markers remained elevated above baseline values 8 days post-race. Interleukin-6, IL-10, and IL-1ra also increased after the race, peaked immediately after to 2 h post-race, and returned to baseline within 72 h. The decrease in plasma volume accounted in part (i.e. 8%) for the increases in the measures after the race, at least for 12 h."}),e.jsxs("div",{className:"table-container

In the present study, it took longer for the athlete to complete the race (11 h 38 min); however, the changes in muscle function, muscle soreness, and blood markers immediately and one day after the race were similar to those reported in the previous study (Suzuki et al., 2006). Neubauer et al. (2008) recently reported changes in blood markers of muscle damage and inflammation immediately after and 1, 5, and 19 days after an Ironman triathlon in 42 well-trained male triathletes (average total race time: 10 h 51 min), and showed similar changes in creatine kinase activity, myoglobin concentration, and IL-6 and IL-lO to those in the present study.

The reduction in VO2max (Figure 2) observed following the Ironman was coupled with a reduction in maximal aerobic power output. At submaximal workloads, an increase in V02 has been reported after exercise resulting in muscle damage. For instance, economy of motion was shown to be reduced following 30 min of downhill running (Braun & Dutto, 2003; Chen, Nosaka, & Tu, 2007), a marathon (Kyroldinen et al., 2000), a competitive duathlon (Calbet, Chavarren, & Dorado, 2001), or 120 maximal eccentric contractions (Paschalis et al., 2005). To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first study to examine the influence of an Ironman triathlon on economy of motion and its time course of recovery. Interestingly, the magnitude and duration of the recovery running economy in the present study was similar to that observed following 30 min of downhill running (Chen et al., 2007). The increase in V02 observed during the submaximal cycling and running may be the result of decreased muscle function and/or altered lower limb kinematics (Chen et al., 2007; Saunders, Pyne, Telford, & Hawley, 2004).

If the decrease in grip strength (e.g. 26% at 2 h post-race) indicates supraspinal fatigue, then supraspinal fatigue would appear to play a partial role in the decrease in muscle function at least in the first 24 h post-event. A precise time course of muscle function recovery following an Ironman triathlon race was not made clear by previous research (Suzuki et a!, 2006). As shown in Figure 3, knee extension and flexion isometric strength returned to baseline after 2 days of recovery, and vertical jump performance recovered within 8 days. Muscle soreness was also alleviated after 8 days of recovery (Table I), and most of the blood markers of muscle damage and inflammation had returned to baseline values by 8 days (Table II)."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"These findings suggest that muscle damage induced by the Ironman triathlon was repaired within about a week.

(2000) reported that recovery from a marathon race occurs within a week. From the present case study, it would appear that the time taken for the muscles to recover from an Ironman triathlon is similar to that induced by marathon running. This may be because most muscle damage occurs during the run phase, and that the level of muscle damage caused by the swimming and cycling phases is minimal due to the lower number and intensity of lengthening contractions."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"Considering the recovery of aerobic performance markers (VO2max, cycling efficiency, and running economy), it may be theoretically possible to perform training at maximal intensity 2 weeks after an Ironman triathlon race.

Further research examining a heterogeneous sample including slower and faster athletes is needed to establish whether muscle damage might be different according to fitness and/or performance level.

He cautioned that once QA becomes routinised it loses its potency as an aid to self-review and development, and admitted that a significant gap still existed between enhancement and compliance.

The parallels with institutional assessment and behaviour are striking. The focus on QA for reward tends to push QE to the icing on the cake. The behaviour is almost Pavlovian and one is reminded of the classic behaviourist statement that 'behaviour is determined by its consequences'. Pursuing this behaviourist analogy suggests that the current QA regime needs to be changed to engage and reward greater QE behaviour. In terms of Biggs' (1999) constructive alignment model, we need to be assessing higher-order learning outcomes and generating appropriate learning activity and behaviour. We are yet to see whether the new QA regime is able to do this."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"This may be too simplistic an analysis as universities are complex organisations with multiple goals and ways of working. We know that facilitating change within universities is notoriously difficult (eg Becher and Kogan, 1992). Behaviorally-driven change management models have limitations in such environments and we need to look at change models which take into account the human and social dimensions of institutional activity. Put another way, how are we going to engage hearts and minds, and facilitate a deep approach to the teaching role rather than a more compliant and minimalist surface approach?"}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"In my experience, new academic staff coming to the usual learning and teaching introductory course are generally keen and motivated to become good teachers. They want to do a good job. Even though one gets a range of reactions to such courses (eg those who want the basic survival kit and those who want some underlying theory or rationale for their teaching), most appear committed to continue to develop their teaching. However, as the process of socialisation into their own departmental cultures occurs these good intentions give way to other priorities. In a research-led university, the RAE is a priority and competes heavily for time. The demands of teaching are also such that development can get edged out to a survival approach."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"All the usual suspects are present, e.g lack of priority given to teaching, rewards systems which do not value teaching as much as research, little time or recognition for teaching development activities. In spite of the higher profile of QA and its impact on institutions, and of institutional learning and teaching strategies, the management of disciplinary groups, especially in a research-led environment, feel that that they have to favour the reputational activities of scholarship and research, and to protect time for them. Under these circumstances engaging people in QE through QA is challenging."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"The reality at the chalk face does not give one grounds for optimism. Awareness of quality policies and issues tends not to be all that high except for those involved in relevant quality committees. The vast volume of QA procedural and related documentation is off-putting and is written in a style which is far from clear and engaging, and appears to have low face validity for many as far as academic practice is concerned. This is possibly unsurprising as it tends to be written by those not directly engaged in teaching and learning. Anyway, universities have various people and units who can answer quality questions related to procedures, so academic staff need not engage with the material directly."}),e.jsx("h3",{children:"QA 'Speak' a Barrier to QE?"}),e.jsx("p",{children:"The volume, clarity and style of much QA material are a concern. For example, take the development of assessment strategies. The QAA Code of Practice (2000) document lacks a sense of theoretical and practical coherence to those charged with writing an assessment strategy. The LTSN Generic Learning and Teaching Centre (Mutch and Brown, 2001) attempted to produce a more coherent guide. It is a better written document but becomes overwhelmed by numerous checklist points in its quest to convey clarity and practical guidance."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"Writing credible and clear QA procedural guides is a craft. They need to possess a convincing rationale which articulates with the reality of academic practice and to offer practical examples.

The development of programme specifications perhaps provided an ideal opportunity to link QA to QE by stimulating fundamental reviews of curricula along the lines of the principles of constructive alignment."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"However, the rationale and guidance provided left many staff unsure and skeptical of why and how they should be proceeding in this way. There are also many real and unresolved issues regarding, say, the use of learning outcomes which many teachers feel require further debate (eg Hussey and Smith, 2002). Typically, quality units issue instructions and highlight the importance of meeting deadlines for the production of programme specifications. While educational developers might offer workshops on the principles of programme specifications, I suspect that in many cases they do not form part of a coherent institutional strategy for quality enhancement. Heads of department and other institutional managers tend to think primarily of meeting deadlines rather than engaging staff in enhancement debates. Programme specifications simply need to be produced to satisfy an external agency's requirements."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"Perhaps this is an exaggerated view of reality but it does highlight worrying trends towards teaching staff disengagement with QA matters and the lack of strategic leadership exhibited by academic managers in the quest to meet short-term political objectives. Possibly a redeeming feature for QA and QE is the development of SEDA and ILT-accredited programmes in many institutions for new teaching staff. Such courses provide an opportunity for long-term engagement in initial professional development which can lead to a deeper understanding of the educational issues and a genuine stimulus for taking a more professional and informed view of teaching and learning. Some departments view the products of such courses as the new 'experts' in learning and teaching, and as people they can rely upon to translate the jargon of QA and provide guidance and consultancy on local teaching policy and practice."}),e.jsx("h3",{children:"An Innovation Perspective"}),e.jsx("p",{children:"In their study of radical innovations in Swedish universities, Berg and Ostergren (1977) employed Lewin's (1951) systems perspective as an analytical framework.

QE drivers are difficult to locate. Innovatory teaching is recognised but not necessarily rewarded. If it is too innovatory, it is perhaps even frowned upon in case it falls outside QA expectations. What should be primarily developmental activities, such as staff appraisal, observation of teaching and student feedback, are increasingly used as crude performance measures of individual teachers in the quest to assure quality and standards by managers. This can weaken trust, collegiality, openness and risk-taking."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"In terms of gains and losses for the individual, there are personal gains of professional satisfaction, improved efficiency and improved student learning which are more widespread than the small bands of usual enthusiasts might indicate. Many staff work on their teaching relatively quietly possibly because they do not wish to be identified as teaching enthusiasts! Some institutions have teaching award schemes which recognise excellence and perhaps reward it with money and development time. But on the downside, there is rarely time formally recognised for teaching development, let alone teaching preparation. The allowance for preparation in workload management schemes tends to be minimal. New staff in particular can feel vulnerable under these regimes. In workshops I run on lecture preparation, many new teachers report that they typically spend two days for every hour of lecture preparation. To admit this in a department can suggest lack of competence. Spending time on developing quality teaching and learning, especially in a research-intensive environment, does not get one promotion."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"In terms of ownership, QA can bring a sense of disenfranchisement over academic experience and judgement in teaching matters. A well-meaning bureaucratic QA industry has gradually evolved which appears to many teachers to issue guidelines on policy and practice with little by way of real consultation with practitioners and the reality of their experience, and by being not particularly informed by academic scholarship and research into higher education teaching. Local managers may fume at more impositions but life is too short to create a fuss and so they unconsciously collude to disengage academic practitioners from challenging QA demands and engaging in the QA debate."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"Educational developers to the rescue? Possibly, but in some institutions their status has been eroded in favour of strengthening QA units to ensure that external requirements are met. Professional administrators rather than academic practitioners or educational developers increasingly advise institutional learning and teaching policy bodies perhaps because they are felt to be a safer pair of hands politically in QA terms. Even QE support functions (eg professional development) have become increasingly subsumed within the professional administrative sector, which arguably removes them from their roots and ownership in academic practice. Implicitly, this can send a message that QA and QE are things that are done to academics rather than with them or by them."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"Institutional and local leadership should ideally be able to stand back from the detail, see the bigger picture and inspire a way forward towards strategically and credibly coherent outcomes. With the pressures many universities are under, high quality leadership and management would seem vital in terms of creating a vision, signing people up to it and constructing a practical and effective strategy for achieving agreed goals. The politicised environment in which universities operate has led to a more political style of leadership and management in many institutions. The rhetoric of goals, targets and strategies often gives way to the quick fix."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"Maybe this is understandable in response to changing external demands and the survival instinct, but it undermines deep thought and reflection, and the achievement of long-term meaningful goals."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"As well as the head of department, there is now an infrastructure of leaders and management co-ordinators for learning and teaching in most institutions.

At the institutional level we still have some way to go in conceptualizing and implementing effective strategies for learning and teaching in a co-ordinated way and linking these holistically to other institutional strategies."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"The above analysis suggests that the long-standing issues of recognition and reward for teaching, and time for development remain in a system where there are increasing demands on an academic's time. QA demands have failed to engage practitioners in a deep sense and there are increasing tensions as traditional development activities are increasingly used as evidence of performance. Institutional investment in QE has tended to migrate towards strengthening QA systems which are often managed centrally. At the same time, academic ownership of QA, and increasingly of QE support processes, has been weakened."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"The one optimistic QE development is that of SEDA- and ILT-accredited programmes for new lecturers which are typically run by educational developers or education academics, and which are underpinned by scholarship and research, and encourage a critical, reflective and questioning attitude.

We need to place a greater emphasis on Continuing Professional Development (CPD) and one way of elevating its importance is through some form of accreditation scheme. Such a scheme needs to be simple to operate and not unduly burdensome. SEDA has already initiated work in this area but credit-bearing CPD provision through institutional validation may prove an attractive option for some staff who want the value and currency of credit to contribute towards a recognised qualification."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"There are issues to resolve, however, if staff are to feel a sense of ownership over their own CPD. There are tensions between institutional human resources and learning and teaching strategies. While the human resources function needs to concern itself with the delivery of its corresponding institutional strategy, institutional restructuring has tended to bring the educational development function within human resources operation and removed it from an academic and scholarship base. If CPD is to articulate genuinely with academic practice, feel collegial and credible, and be informed by scholarship and research, educational development needs to be relocated where it has always belonged — within an academic rather than an administrative environment."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"Finally, we need to professionalise the management of teaching and learning so that those responsible for key areas of educational strategy and delivery, whether it be the course coordinator, faculty leader or pro-vice-chancellor, can exercise informed and strategic leadership.

The strongest predictors of shoulder counter-rotation were shoulder alignment angle and pelvic–shoulder separation angle. The current results suggest that a large proportion of fast bowlers may be at a higher risk of lumbar injury from the use of the mixed-action technique.

Bowlers can use a side-on, semi-open, front-on, or mixed action (National Cricket Academy, 2009; Portus, Mason, Elliott, Pfitzner, & Done, 2004). Each of these actions has distinctly different kinematic properties, such as shoulder alignment, pelvic alignment, and run-up speed (Bartlett, Stockill, Elliott, & Burnett, 1996). The general consensus is that the side-on, semi-open, and front-on actions are relatively safe and effective bowling techniques. The mixed action is associated with an elevated risk of lumbar injury (Burnett et al., 1996; Hardcastle, 1991; Portus et al., 2004), although this association may be restricted to younger bowling populations (Elliott, Davis, Khangure, & Hardcastle, 1993; Portus, Galloway, Elliott, & Lloyd, 2007; Stretch, 1995). The mixed-action technique has been classified in terms of shoulder counter-rotation (i.e. the maximum amount of rotation of the rear shoulder away from the batter in the transverse plane during the delivery stride) and pelvis-shoulder separation angle (Burnett, Elliott, & Marshall, 1995; Elliott et al., 1993; Portus et al., 2004)."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"Researchers have proposed a variety of threshold criteria to formally classify these bowling actions.

Burnett et al. (1995) proposed a similar convention system, but removed the back foot angle criterion, used a shoulder alignment of 200° to differentiate between the side-on and front-on actions, and specified more than 200° of both pelvis-shoulder angle separation and counter-rotation to classify a mixed action. Portus and colleagues (Portus, Sinclair, Burke, Moore, & Farhart, 2000) used a classification system similar to that of Elliott et al. (1993), but changed the limiting criteria of back foot angle to 2900° and counter-rotation to 400°. In a more recent study, Portus et al. (2004) rejected the back foot angle criteria, and specified the following to classify action types: side-on (shoulder alignment 210°); semi-open (210°–240°); and mixed (pelvis-shoulder separation angle or counter-rotation >30°)."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"A significant disadvantage of the angle convention system used to classify action types is that shoulder and pelvic alignment angles are measured with respect to a vector running from the front to the rear shoulder and hip joints, respectively (Figure 1). Using this angle convention system, shoulder and pelvic alignment angles are measured in a range from 180° (perfectly side-on) to 270° (perfectly front-on) (Elliott, Foster, & Gray, 1986). There is no reason why these alignment angles cannot be defined with respect to a 0°-reference line in the direction of the stumps at the batting end (Figure 2) as is alluded to in the coaching literature (Elliott, Foster, & John, 1990).

The fact that fast bowlers can utilize at least four distinct bowling actions to deliver a ball, and that one of these, the mixed action, has been associated with an elevated risk of lumbar injury means that it is important to assess the distribution of bowling action types within a bowling population. Trends in bowling action type can potentially vary with the evolution of coaching paradigms, the environment, and the techniques of the most successful bowlers at an instant in time. In addition, basic coaching programmes in Australia and throughout the world train coaches to identify these basic action types (Australian Cricket Board, 1998). From a coaching perspective, it is also essential that the important kinematic determinants of bowling action type are thoroughly studied, particularly with respect to the mixed action.

Even with respect to the alternative classifications of action type, the percentage of side-on bowlers in the sample was still less than 20%. In addition, shoulder alignment data suggest that even those bowlers classified as side-on did not adhere to the classical side-on form: shoulders aligned wicket to wicket and head positioned outside the front arm to view the target area (Marylebone Cricket Club, 1976). Instead, the shoulders were still relatively open (21.7 ± 1.8°) to the line of the stumps, and some previous classification systems such as that of Burnett et al.

Of the remaining bowlers, only two were side-on (4.8%), six semi-open (14.3%), and three front-on (7.1%). Ranson and colleagues (Ranson, Burnett, King, Patel, & O'Sullivan, 2008) analysed 50 English county professional bowlers and found a similar distribution of bowlers: 39 mixed (78%), eight semi-open (16%), and three side-on (6%). Like the New Zealand sample, the Australian and English bowlers have moved away from the use of the traditional side-on bowling technique and have largely adopted the mixed-action, which generally requires an open shoulder alignment at back foot contact (Portus et al., 2004). This represents a significant departure from the traditional coaching literature, which emphasizes a side-on action. It is not possible to compare quantitatively the action distributions of bowlers in past eras. However, an observation of past cricket video footage (Arlott, 1994) and even older action photography of bowlers in the early 1900s (Beldam & Fry, 1906) reveals that the side-on action was predominant throughout most of cricket history."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"The move away from the side-on bowling technique would not be problematic if this was compensated by a significant increase in semi-open and front-on techniques. However, in this study there was only one more bowler in the semi-open group than in the side-on group, and there was only one front-on bowler in the sample. Instead, there was a predominance of mixed bowlers. Of the 22 mixed-action bowlers, 20 were classified as mixed based on the amount of shoulder counter-rotation. In fact, the majority of the mixed-action bowlers (59.1%) had shoulder counter-rotations in excess of 40°, with a further 22.7% of these having shoulder counter-rotations in excess of 50°. There were even 4.5% with shoulder counter-rotations in excess of 60°. This is problematic, as there are no known benefits of high levels of shoulder counter-rotation. Portus et al. (2000) found that shoulder counter-rotation was associated with decreased accuracy, particularly in the latter overs of an 8-over spell. In addition, although not a causal mechanism of lumbar injury (Ranson et al., 2008), many studies have shown that shoulder counter-rotation is associated with an increased risk of lumbar injury (Burnett et al., 1996; Elliott & Khangure, 2002; Portus et al., 2004, 2007).

One such kinematic factor was shoulder alignment. The mean shoulder alignment at back foot contact for the mixed-action group was 60.4 ± 12.6° (Table V), which was over 10° in excess of the shoulder alignment required to classify a front-on bowler. Mixed-action bowlers tended to use a front-on shoulder alignment. Furthermore, post-hoc multi-comparison tests show that the mixed-action group had a significantly more open shoulder alignment (22.4 ± 5.2° and 39.2 ± 5.6°) than both the semi-open and side-on groups, respectively. There was also a strong correlation between shoulder alignment and counter-rotation (r² = 0.622, P = 0.007), effectively showing that shoulder alignment angle is a strong predictor of shoulder counter-rotation. Bowlers with an open or front-on shoulder alignment may need to counter-rotate the shoulders to a more side-on alignment at front foot contact to pre-stretch the anterior shoulder musculature when the bowling arm is horizontal behind the body prior to the acceleration phase of the bowling arm. Hence, there is some evidence to support the recommendation for bowlers to develop the semi-open technique rather than adopt the more open shoulder alignment of the front-on technique wherever possible to prevent the possibility of degeneration to a mixed-action technique, which becomes even more likely when fatigued (Portus et al., 2000)."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"Previous researchers have proposed that the pelvis—shoulder separation angle is a predictor of shoulder counter-rotation (Elliott et al., 1990).

This mechanism cannot be confirmed in this study, but we found that pelvis—shoulder separation angle accounted for 20.2% of the variation in shoulder counter-rotation. However, even if the pelvis and shoulders were relatively aligned at back foot contact, this is not sufficient to prevent a bowler from counter-rotating the shoulders. There is no anatomical constraint in place during the delivery stride to prevent the shoulders from rotating in either direction — that is, either rotating to the left (anticlockwise) away from the batsman, or counter-rotating towards the right (clockwise). Hence, in addition to reducing pelvis—shoulder separation angle, bowlers also need to establish independent movement patterns if they intend to prevent excessive shoulder counter-rotation."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"Although not significantly associated with shoulder counter-rotation, back foot alignment was moderately associated with pelvic alignment and pelvis—shoulder separation angle at back foot contact, both of which were moderately associated with shoulder counter-rotation.

When such opposing rotation becomes high, bowling accuracy may be compromised, since the relative motion between the pelvis and shoulders needs to be compensated for rapidly.

However, if pelvic counter-rotation occurs at a higher rate than shoulder counter-rotation, then there is an increase in the pelvis—shoulder separation angle as the delivery stride progresses. This would tend to increase the pre-stretch of the trunk rotators, producing a powerful counter-rotation of the shoulders, since the pelvis is closing more rapidly than the shoulders.

In addition, cricket coaches have more access to two-dimensional video motion analysis systems, which are more effective in measuring shoulder rotation.

As the mixed-action technique may compromise performance and increase the risk of lumbar injury, a fundamental coaching practice throughout the world is to identify a bowler's action type. The two major predictors of the mixed-action technique are open shoulder alignment and pelvis—shoulder separation angle. Coaches may consider closing the shoulder alignment and reducing the pelvis—shoulder separation angle to limit the amount of shoulder counter-rotation. An increase in the proportion of side-on and semi-open bowlers may result in positive performance characteristics and reduce the risk of lumbar injury.

Enhancing students’ motivation towards exercise is one of the main objectives for physical education teachers. Motivation theorists argue that situational factors of the lesson could strongly affect students’ motivation (Biddle, 2001; Roberts, 2001; Treasure, 2001). Physical education teachers, therefore, should focus their efforts on the structure of a motivational climate that will foster activity participation, effort, persistence, enjoyment, and maximize the effects of the learning process.

This is the main criterion that defines success and failure of involvement in activity. Two different ways to perceive competence in an achievement setting have been proposed (Nicholls, 1989). The first, labelled “task orientation”, represents an undifferentiated conception of competence and effort. Task oriented individuals believe that effort will lead to high performance and, therefore, demonstration of competence (Nicholls, 1989; Roberts, 2001). For task-oriented individuals, success is defined based on self-referenced criteria, such as personal improvement and mastery of the tasks (Nicholls, 1989; Roberts, 2001). The second way to perceive competence in an achievement setting, labelled “ego orientation”, reflects a differentiated conception of competence and effort, suggesting that results with low effort show high competence. For ego-oriented individuals, success is defined based on normative criteria, such as comparison with others, performance norms, and demonstration of superior ability (Nicholls, 1989; Roberts, 2001)."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{className:"mb-4",children:"Elliot and his colleagues (e.g. Elliot, 1997, 2006; Elliot & Church, 1997) suggested that ego orientation should be differentiated into approach and avoidance forms, performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals.

More recently, Elliot and McGregor (2001) suggested that the approach—avoidance distinction should also be employed on task orientation, resulting in a 2 x 2 model (mastery-approach, mastery-avoidance, performance-approach, and performance-avoidance). Although research in sport and physical education is still limited, there is evidence that mastery goals and approach goals are linked with more positive cognitive, affective, and behavioural outcomes (Conroy, Elliot, & Hofer, 2003; Cury, Elliot, Da Fonseca, & Moller, 2006)."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{className:"mb-4",children:"Achievement goals have been used to describe either individuals’ predispositions (Nicholls, 1989) or experiences during involvement (i.e. perceptions of motivational climate; Ames, 1984, 1992a, 1992b).

Dispositional goals adjust the way individuals perceive certain cues of the environment and alter the probability to adopt certain achievement behaviour. Situational experiences alter or diminish this probability. The relative strength of dispositional goals versus situational experiences determines which of the two predicts behaviour best, with the strongest of these being the best predictor (Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Roberts, 2001; Roberts, Treasure, & Kavussanu, 1997; Treasure, 2001).

The basic aim of the Authority dimension is to enhance students’ participation in decision making. It has been proposed that physical education teachers should encourage students to participate in decisions regarding various aspects of the lesson, and thus provide opportunities to develop their responsibility (Ames, 1992a, 1992b).

The main objective of the Grouping dimension is to alter the social interaction during the class.

Teaching sport skills is a primary objective of physical education lessons. However, limited data are available regarding the role of motivational climate on sport skill development and, especially, performance-related responses in the physical education context. State anxiety and self-efficacy are such responses. Both state anxiety and self-efficacy are considered among the most important variables affecting motor performance. There is substantial research evidence suggesting that pre-competitive state anxiety and self-efficacy can determine the standard and quality of performance in sports. Anxiety is negatively related to task performance in competitive sport (Cerin, Szabo, Hunt, & Williams, 2000; Eubank, Collins, & Smith, 2000; Woodman & Hardy, 2003). Self-efficacy is also an important predictor of task performance in competitive sport; high self-efficacy is associated with better performance (Beauchamp, Bray, & Albinson, 2002; Bray, Balaguer, & Duda, 2004; Moritz, Feltz, Fahrbach, & Mack, 2000). Furthermore, self-efficacy is a positive predictor of academic performance (Linnenbrink & Pintrich, 2003; Thelwell, Lane, & Weston, 2007).

Therefore, the purpose of the present study was to test the effectiveness of TARGET in enhancing self-efficacy and skill performance and reducing anxiety responses related to skill learning in physical education lessons. More specifically, the present study attempted to examine the effectiveness of TARGET in real conditions in terms of curriculum, time, teacher, and student constraints. Therefore, the number of sessions was limited to that described in the national curriculum. The length of each session was restricted to the 45 min duration of a physical education lesson, the physical education teachers were ordinary teachers without prior experience and knowledge of TARGET or other similar interventions, and the students were typical high school students without a specific interest in track and field.

The Physical Education State Anxiety Scale (PESAS; Barkoukis, Tsorbatzoudis, Grouios, & Rodafinos, 2005) measures three dimensions of anxiety: somatic anxiety, worry, and cognitive processes (6 items each). The somatic anxiety subscale corresponds to feelings of tension and apprehension. The worry subscale corresponds to negative expectations from involvement in the activity. Both constructs are similar to the somatic and cognitive anxiety constructs proposed by multidimensional anxiety theory (Martens, Burton, Vealey, Bump, & Smith, 1990). Cognitive processes, the third subscale, are also a measure of cognitive anxiety. The latter subscale was included based on arguments that cognitive processes, such as attention, cognition, thought, memory, and problem solving during the anxiety experience should be taken into account when examining anxiety (Schwarzer, 1986; Tobias, 1986; Wine, 1982). Participants were asked to rate their anxiety before the execution of two track and field tasks. Responses were indicated on a 5-point Likert scale (1 = not at all, 5 = very much). Examples of somatic anxiety, trait worry, and cognitive processes items are “I sense a feeling of pressure on my chest”, “I am concerned about making errors during task execution”, and “I find it difficult to focus on the PE task presented”, respectively. Barkoukis et al. (2005) supported the factorial validity and reliability of the scale (alphas ranged from 0.79 to 0.83).

Shot put was divided into the turn, the power position, and the delivery phases (e.g. “How confident are you that you can perform the turn phase correctly?”). To measure the generality of self-efficacy, three items were added for each task, asking students how confident they felt about: their performance (e.g. “How confident are you that: your shot put performance will be among the six best performances?”). Students rated their responses on a 10-point Likert scale from 1 (not at all) to 10 (very much). Internal consistency was estimated with Cronbach alpha.

The intervention used in the present study has been applied successfully in the past in physical education and sport and is considered to be effective in creating a task-involving motivational climate (Cecchini et al., 2001; Digelidis et al., 2003; Morgan & Carpenter, 2002; Theeboom et al., 1995; Treasure, 2001).",e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("br",{}),"Results indicated that the application of the intervention had some effects on the variables examined. Self-efficacy has been consistently found to be a strong predictor of sport performance (Bandura, 1997; Escartí & Guzman, 1999; Kane, Marks, Zaccaro, & Blair, 1996; LaGuardia & Labbé, 1993; Moritz et al., 2000). Results revealed that students in the intervention group, compared with those in the control group, reported higher self-efficacy to perform the triple jump. However, no differences were evident between the groups in shot put efficacy. A potential explanation may reside in the possibility that the triple jump requires a less complex technique than the shot put (Bowerman & Freeman, 1991; Carr, 1991). Thus, it may be assumed that during the 10 training units of the programme, through the modelling of the tasks and the experiences acquired while exercising, students formed higher efficacy beliefs about the simpler task (i.e. triple jump) than the more complex task (i.e. shot put). It is possible that more training time is needed to create performance experiences that could alter the efficacy beliefs for the successful completion of a complex task."]}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{className:"mb-4",children:"In terms of the effectiveness of the intervention programme on sport skill development, no differences were reported in the technical execution of triple jump. The triple jump technique is considered relatively simple, and thus it could be assumed that all participants reached an adequate level of technical execution after training. On the other hand, results showed improvement in technical execution of the shot put. The latter findings are consistent with those of Theeboom et al. (1995) and support previous evidence that the use of innovative methods can enhance skill development in physical education (Ashy, Lee, & Landin, 1988; Dyson & O’Sullivan, 1998; Parker & Lepper, 1992; Silverman, 1985). However, as the intervention had a positive effect on self-efficacy to perform the triple jump, one would expect that it would have a more robust influence on the performance indices used. The weak effects of the programme on performance may be due to its short duration. If this is the case, one could argue that the more enjoyable way the drills were applied to the intervention group resulted in better assimilation of the task’s aspects. That is, students were more focused on the task at hand, showed more interest, and applied more effort. Another possible explanation is that of Smith and colleagues (Smith, Smoll, & Barnett, 1995), who reported that children’s skill is unstable and links to psychological factors are difficult to establish. This might imply that although the intervention produced changes in self-efficacy, these changes did not affect skill development."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{className:"mb-4",children:"In terms of anxiety, the results indicated that anxiety decreased after the intervention for both groups. This implies that familiarization with the tasks was the key element that diminished students’ anxiety. Although there was a trend for lower scores in the intervention group, the intervention did not impact significantly on anxiety. These findings are not in accord with our hypothesis, that a supportive environment would have a positive influence on anxiety responses during the learning process. A plausible explanation might lie in the nature of the tasks being taught. The relatively simple motion sequence of the triple jump, one of the two tasks being taught, might have resulted in low anxiety in both experimental and control students. In the future, more complex tasks should be examined to alter the anxiety levels of students. Additionally, perhaps the number of the lessons was not adequate to create changes in anxiety responses. State anxiety is an emotional state largely affected by the predisposition to perceive external stimuli as threatening. Therefore, it may take more time to alter these perceptions. To determine whether this is the case, future studies should apply TARGET for longer periods of time."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{className:"mb-4",children:"Another possible explanation might be the context of the study. We attempted to alter the anxiety responses by telling the students that their performance would affect their physical education grade. However, students knew that this was only one test among several others that would determine their grade. Furthermore, the contribution of physical education grade to general academic grade is minimal. Hence, it is possible that the students did not perceive the situation as threatening for their grade and, accordingly, responded with relatively low levels of anxiety at the task at hand. Also, it might be attributed to the students’ relationship with their physical education teachers. In general, students have a comfortable relationship with their physical education teachers and physical education is usually a fun lesson. Hence, perhaps they did not perceive the test as threatening to themselves. Finally, another possible reason for the unexpected small differences between the control and experiment groups may be due to the inefficient realization of the intervention by the teachers. Indeed, the lessons’ records indicate that during the first lessons, the teachers were unable to employ the entire TARGET programme simultaneously. In conjunction with the small duration of the intervention, this might have reduced the effect of the intervention on the psychological variables under study."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{className:"mb-4",children:"Due to the application of TARGET in real settings by regular physical education teachers, the lack of a more rigorous check of the manipulation of the TARGET structures is a possible limitation of the study. We preferred to observe the lessons to provide immediate feedback to the teachers and help them employ the intervention more effectively. Yet, a systematic monitoring of the lesson with sophisticated tools (see Curtner-Smith & Todorovich, 2002; Sproule, Kinchin, Yelling, McMorris, & McNeill, 2002) could have provided more information on the fidelity of the experimental condition. Furthermore, the duration of the intervention was relatively short. Applying TARGET for longer periods of time could have more salient effects on psychological variables (Barkoukis et al., 2008a). Another possible limitation of the study is the absence of a follow-up measurement. The effects of the intervention have been found to decline with time (Digelidis et al., 2003) and future research should examine the time over which these effects start to deteriorate. Finally, the students were instructed that personal improvement would affect their physical education grade. This might have resulted in a conscious underperformance pre-intervention to guarantee the maximum improvement observed post-intervention. Although there was no significant improvement in all aspects of students’ performance to justify this rationale, future studies should control for this effect."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{className:"mb-4",children:"To summarize, the application of the TARGET programme during 10 teaching units of track and field tasks had a positive influence on certain cognitive and performance aspects of the physical education lesson. However, the changes produced were not as strong as would be expected. The present study attempted to examine the effectiveness of TARGET under normal conditions. The aims of physical education are to introduce sport activities to students, to develop their gross motor abilities, and to foster their interest in sport and physical activity (Tsorbatzoudis et al., 2008). Therefore, the time and the equipment offered and students’ interests do not guarantee strong learning results. Hence, the findings of the present study are thought to describe adequately the impact of TARGET on motor skill development and students’ cognitive and affective responses in real physical education lessons."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{className:"mb-4",children:"Future research should examine further the role of motivational climate and motivation-related variables, such as basic psychological needs and motivational regulations, on motor skill development and cognitive and affective responses in physical education. Additionally, future studies should examine the influence of TARGET on teaching other skills and sports in physical education lessons. The findings of the present study also have important implications for practitioners. Physical education teachers should foster a task-involving climate by using TARGET structures. More specifically, they should provide a variety of tasks and activities during the lesson. They should present these tasks in an interesting and challenging way to the students. Furthermore, they should provide students with meaningful choices, allow them to make decisions during the lesson, and dictate the learning process. Physical education teachers should praise students’ achievements (goal attainment, out-of-school achievements in sport, etc.) and personal improvement but avoid social comparison. In addition, they should foster learning through cooperation by creating small and heterogeneous teams during the teaching process. Finally, effort and personal improvement in the taught skills, rather than normative and peer comparisons, should be the main criteria for students’ evaluation."}),e.jsx("h3",{className:"text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2",children:"Conclusion"}),e.jsx("p",{className:"mb-4",children:"This study provides evidence that a task-involving motivational climate, facilitated by the TARGET structures, can enhance self-efficacy and technical skill execution in physical education.

Local and national governments, international institutions and non-government organizations pay attention to educate people to be more aware of disaster and become prepare when disaster occurs (Adiyoso, W & Kanegae H, 2012). There government bodies began to give serious attention to the problem of disaster and established disaster management centers in areas that are expected to provide services to the public related to disaster problems that often occur.

Disaster education is important for students who live in coastal area. Integration with science is feasible. Science curriculum for elementary school in Indonesia has some contents to prepare students for understanding about environment and disaster. The science curriculum has emphasizes to hands-on experience through practical activities.

Annually, 1.35 million road traffic-related deaths are recorded, which represents 3700 deaths daily (WHO, 2018). Although a global public health threat, its fatality rate is more severe in emerging countries (low and middle-income countries) compared to advanced nations (WHO, 2018). Hence, it has been termed a significant epidemic of contemporary times exacerbated by increasing urban development and industrialisation (Jothula & Sreeharshika, 2021), as well as the upsurge in human and vehicular population and poor road infrastructure."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"In Nigeria, the rate of road crashes has recently taken an alarming dimension. According to the 2023 annual report of road crashes in Nigeria, there were 10,617 recorded road traffic crashes, out of which 5,081 were fatal. Horrendously, 7% of the fatalities (342) were made up of child casualties (FRSC, 2023). Unfortunately, the rate of traffic accidents involving children is hardly reported. A fact sheet of the global status report revealed that traffic-related deaths constitute a significant reason for the death of children and young persons between the ages of 5-29 years (WHO, 2023). It is on this basis that children have been described as a risk group for road traffic crash involvements. Despite the alarming threat associated with road traffic accidents involving school children, a dearth of empirical studies has deemed it necessary to explore the level of knowledge primary school pupils have about road safety measures, particularly in Benin Metropolis. Therefore, this gap in the literature calls for an empirical study of this nature to ascertain the knowledge level of these young learners. This is based on the premise that the level of education children have about safety serves as a foundation for imbibing good safety habits for a productive later life."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"The prevalence of traffic-related crashes among school children has been described as a monumental global threat. For instance, it was evident in a study conducted in Uganda that about half of the children in Kwampe were involved in traffic-related accidents every school year (Nakito et al., 2006). In India, a self-reported prevalence rate of 17.3 percent of road injuries involving children commuting to school was noted (Kansara & Yadav, 2023). Above half of these fatalities were among pedestrians, cyclists, and motorcyclists in emerging nations of the world (WHO, 2023). Surprisingly, 78 percent of these accidents involving child pedestrians are attributable to their failure to watch out for oncoming vehicles properly, in comparison, 38 percent were linked with negligence, recklessness, and susceptibility to haste (Department of Transport, 2015). Besides, the gender and age of the children and the socioeconomic status of the parents had been linked with a predisposition to road accidents. Setorwofia (2020) found that young female children within the age range of five to nine years, usually in the lower class, tend to be prone to pedestrian crashes; however, Kaur (2022) noted the existence of gender differences in the level of awareness of road safety practice in favour of females' students. Congruently, gender difference in road safety knowledge was significantly evident among medical students. Remarkably, such gender difference was apparently not noted in their attitude, practice and abeyance of traffic rules (Manjula, Vijaylaxmi & Ashok, 2017)."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("p",{children:"Globally, there has been a clarion call towards promoting a safer road for all users. This call can only be attainable where people have appropriate road safety knowledge. Studies have suggested differences in knowledge regarding road safety rules, which increase with education. Adebimpe et al. (2019) asserted that more than half of secondary school students in Jos, Nigeria, could identify three of the four road safety features. In India, 59 and 26 percent of adolescents in selected schools in the district of Solan had adequate and moderate knowledge of road safety regulations, respectively (Suprabha & Madhuri, 2020). Congruently, above half of the secondary school students in Nepal and somewhat above half of Kottayam schools, children demonstrated moderately satisfactory knowledge of road safety rules and regulations (Baniya & Timilsina, 2018; Anujalekshmi & Anju, 2015). Additionally, 58.3 percent of pharmacy students adequately possess knowledge of road safety regulations in Telangana (Jothula & Sreeharshika, 2021). Nevertheless, Anujalekshmi and Anju (2015) reported that forty-five percent of school children knew about road safety regulations. Contrary to expectations, studies suggest that knowledge of traffic regulations among primary school children may not be significantly influenced by geographical location. For instance, Indhumathy and Thenmozhi (2016) reported that 40% and 28% of children in rural communities demonstrated moderate and adequate knowledge of traffic rules, respectively. Similarly, findings from Sathyabama and Vijayaprasath (2019) revealed that a substantial proportion of students in peri-urban areas lacked sufficient understanding of road safety signs, with 50% exhibiting inadequate knowledge, while 49% and only 1% demonstrated moderate and adequate knowledge, respectively."}),e.jsx("br",{}),e.jsx("h3",{children:"Statement of the Problem"}),e.jsx("p",{children:"Worldwide, road traffic accidents are among the leading cause of injury and mortality. Painfully, children are among the vulnerable population for traffic related injuries and deaths. This vulnerability is not farfetched as it has been ascribed to many factors including their size, low perceptual capability to correctly judge distance and speed among other things. While, there has been concerned from authorities in preventing road traffic accidents through interventions and awareness campaigns, children remain susceptible to traffic accidents as a result of the insufficient knowledge of traffic rules and regulations. This knowledge gap in road safety rules specifically, in low and medium income countries has remarkably contributed to high risk behaviours such as horseplay, jaywalking, improper road crossing behaviour among others. This situation is further exacerbated by inadequate road safety education in schools curriculum and child centred road safety awareness programmes including insufficient parental guidance on road safety behaviour.

The relatively low proportion of pupils with poor road safety knowledge in the present study contrasts with the 32% reported among primary school children in rural communities by Indhumathy and Thenmozhi (2016).
