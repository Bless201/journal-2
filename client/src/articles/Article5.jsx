    <h3>Abstract</h3>
    <p className="abstract">
      In this study the somatotype characteristics of elite female basketball (n=11) and 14 handball (n = 14) players who participated at the 1995 All-Africa Games, held in Harare, Zimbabwe, were measured using the Health-Carter anthropometric method. The basketball and handball players had a mean age of 22.5 years and 19.2 years, respectively. The basketball (3.1-3.4-2.7) and handball players (3.7-3.8-2.5) clustered at the central part of the somatochart, which clearly shows that both groups have similar somatotype characteristics. They were however, different from the South Australian, Venezuelan and Hungarian players who were predominantly dominant in mesomorphy and endomorphy, but had comparably lower ectomorphic ratings. Similar physique structure observed in the elite female African basketball and handball players may be a reflection of the physical adaptation to the demand of competitive ball games training. Further research is needed to clarify these issues as well as the socio-economic background of the players.

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Somatotyping is one of the most recent developments in the 20th century history of morphological taxonomy and constitutional investigation. In the fifth century BC. Hippocrates described people with long thin bodies as habitus phthisicus and those with short thick bodies as habitus apoplecticus (Carter & Heath, 1990). Previous research has shown that the most successful athletes have physique structures best suited to their particular sports and that differences in physique will emphasize the important aspects of such somatotype. Somatotyping is expressed in a three-number rating, representing endomorphy (fatness), mesomorphy (musculo-skeletal robustness) and ectomorphy (linearity). In theory we expect to find the most successful athletes to have physique best suited to their particular sports and that differences in physique will denote the important aspect of physique such as the somatotype.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Chovanova and Zapletolova (1980) found that female basketball guards were more mesomorphic while centres were ectomorphic. Shoup and Malina (1985) found differences between Whites, Blacks and Mexican Americans. Shoup (1978) reported a mean rating of 4-4-3 for University of Texas players, while Meszaros and Mohacsi (1982) found no differences between Hungarian players in the early and late 1970s (Eiben, 1981). Whithers et al. (1987) found South Australian female basketball players to be 3.7-4.0-2.9 and Brief (1986) reported that Bolivian basketball players were more mesormophic with less ectomorphic components (4.3-3.8-2.1).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Few studies have been reported on the somatotype of handball players in the literature. The Czechoslovakian samples, which were 10 years apart, differed in height and somatotype. The 1977 sample was lighter, taller and less endomesomorphic than the 1967 sample (Stepnicka et al., 1979). The Hungarian sample showed the opposite trend. The Hungarian sample in the early and late 1970's was more endomorphic, but the players were not different in height and weight (Meszaros & Mohasci, 1982). Eiben (1981) reported a mean somatotype of 4.5-4.1-2.2 for another Hungarian sample.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      Both basketball and handball are team sports that require high level of intensity, strength, power and endurance particularly during competition. In Europe, players from both sports have shown to have high mesomorphic and endomorphic ratings with relatively low ectomorphic ratings, but little information exists in the literature on female African basketball and handball players. The purpose of this report, therefore, was to describe the somatotype of elite African basketball and handball players who participated at the 6th All-Africa Games held in Harare, Zimbabwe and compare them with those studied elsewhere.
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Method and Procedure</h3>
    <p>
      A total of 11 elite female African basketball and 14 handball players with a mean age of 22.5 and 19.2 years, respectively drawn from among the players who participated at the 1995 All-Africa Games served as the subjects of this study. A team of 35 students from the University of the North, University of Botswana and Potchefstroom University for CHE as well as two representatives of Zimbabwe who were trained as anthropometrists by Prof. J.E.L. Carter, Prof. L.O. Amusa, Dr. A.L. Toriola, Dr J.H. de Ridder and Dr M. Wekesa at Potchesfstroom University for CHE, South Africa, assisted in the data collection. Anthropometrists were required to undertake reliability testing as part of their training and to achieve technical errors within internationally accepted limits. Somatic variables were determined by direct measurements with every subject being measured by one anthropometrist and remeasured by another. When the two records for a particular dimension were in close agreement, the average value was considered to estimate the true datum satisfactorily. The close criteria required no greater differences between the two records than 0.3cm for heights, widths and girths, while for skinfolds measurements no difference between the two records were more than 0.2mm. When the initial determination did not satisfy the applicable criterion, two additional independent determinations were made with the value taken to represent the dimension of metric scale, the average of the homogenous three (Cameron, 1984; Carter et al., 1994).
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The following somatic variables were measured on each subject according to the methods used at the 6th World Championships in swimming, diving, synchronised swimming and water polo (Carter et al., 1994): height, weight, 2 breadths (femur and humerus) 2 girths (arm girth flexed and tensed, calf girth) and 6 skinfold measurements (triceps, subscapular, supraspinale, medical calf, biceps and front thigh).
    </p>
    <br />

    <h4>Statistical Analysis</h4>
    <p>
      Heath-Carter anthropometric equations were used to determine each of the somatotype components (Carter & Heath, 1990). The Statistical package of the Potchefstroom University for CHE (Windows 3.1) was used for the analyses, which included the calculation of the somatotype components and somatotype frequency categories. Significant differences in the somatotype ratings of the female basketball and handball players were assessed using the student-test (p&lt;0.05).
    </p>
    <br />

    <h3>Results and Discussion</h3>
    <p>
      Table 1 represents the mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values of the absolute body size, and somatotypes of the elite female African basketball and handball players. The female basketball players were significantly (p&lt;0.05) taller (176.8±8.51cm vs 166.8±3.19cm), possessed more body mass (70.7±5.42kg vs. 61.5±7.91kg) and were older (22.5±4.01 years Vs 19.2±3.82 years) than their handball counterparts.

      The mean somatotype ratings of both basketball and handball players were 3.1-3.4-2.7 and 3.7-3.8-4.8, respectively. There were no significant differences in the mean somatotypes of the two groups. Both groups had a high percentage frequency of somatotype in the central category (45% of basketball group and 35% of handball players). This clearly depicts that elite female African basketball and handball players had similar somatotype components since the ratings did not differ by more than one unit. However, 21.4% of the hand-ballers and 27% of the basketballers fell within the mesomorphic endormorph and endomorphic mesomorph categories, respectively.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      These results are not surprising because of the similarities between competitive basketball and handball games. The two games resemble each other with regard to some of the fundamental skills and playing patterns (dribbling, passing and duration of the game), but are different in terms of shooting skills. One cannot therefore, expect a significant disparity in the somatotype component ratings of the two ball game players.

      The players were however, different from the South Australian (Withers et al., 1987), Hungarian (Eiben, 1981), Canadian (Alexander, 1976) and Venezuelan (Perez, 1981) female basketball players who were predominant in the mesomorphic and endomorphic components, but had relatively lower ratings in ectomorphy than the samples reported in several studies. The 1977 Czechoslovakian handballers (Stepnicka et al., 1979) and 1979 to 1980 Hungarian handball teams (Meszaros & Mohacsi, 1982) were also dominant in mesomorphy and endomorphy, but were less preponderant in the ectomorphic component.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
      The comparable structure (physique/somatotypes) observed in the elite female African basketball and handball players may be a reflection of the physical adaptation to the training requirements of the two sports. The possibility also exists that these female players chose to play the sports best suited to their physiques. Further research is needed to clarify these issues as well as the socio-economic background of the players. It will also be interesting to see how these female players compare with other female players in netball, athletics, hockey and other ball games in terms of their physique and somatotype.
